<p>The Household Disaggregation model classifies a TAZ’s households by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Household Size</li>
<li>Income</li>
<li>Number of Workers</li>
</ul>
<p>Household Disaggregation is done in three steps with each step adding another level of disaggregation: estimating the distribution of households by size group, further disaggregation by income group and income level, and further disaggregation by number of workers per household. This results in 96 groupings when using the four income groups or 48 groupings when using low/high income levels.</p>
<p>For disaggregation to household size groups, the following lookup files contain the distribution of households across the six household size groups according the average household size for the three life cycle categories: Lookup - HH Size_LC1.csv, Lookup - HH Size_LC2.csv, and Lookup - HH Size_LC3.csv. The distributions in these files are grouped by county. There is also a third lookup file that contains a regional distribution used for comparison purposes: Lookup - HH Size.csv. When computing income ratios, the regional median household income of $74,946 (2019 dollars) is used from the latest ACS.</p>
<p>Further disaggregation by income groups is done in multiple steps. First a target TAZ distribution by income is calculated using a county distribution found in Lookup - Income.csv. Then a Fratar/Furness balancing method is used to get the matrix distribution across income groups and household sizes. The matrix is initialized with the values found in <a href="#tbl-hhsize-seed">Table&nbsp;1</a>, which is hard-coded into the 2_HHDisaggregation.s script with the source being the 2012 Household Survey. The balancing method is run through until convergence is reached at (0.0001) or a max of 15 iterations.</p>

<p>Final disaggregation by worker is a simple distribution which is found in the Lookup – Worker.csv file. This file contains a distribution across the worker groups by each of the 24 combinations of the six household size groups and the four income groups. Households are then aggregated back to the two income levels (low/high).</p>
<section id="household-size" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="household-size">Household Size</h2>
<p>The Household Disaggregation model estimates how many households are in six Household Size categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 person households</li>
<li>2 person households</li>
<li>3 person households</li>
<li>4 person households</li>
<li>5 person households</li>
<li>6 or more person households</li>
</ul>
<p>The model uses the TAZ’s average household size to look up the share of households in each of the six Household Size categories. This is done independently for each of the three Life Cycle categories estimated in the previous model step.</p>
<p><mark>???UPDATE???</mark> 2010 Census Block Group data was used to determine the initial relationship between average household size and the number of households in each size category. To increase sample size, all Block Groups in Utah were included. Draft curves were estimated from the data’s polynomial trendline.</p>
<p><mark>???Plots for “2010 Census Block Group Data - Household Size Share by Average Household Size”???</mark></p>
<p>The results from the equations derived from teh Census data were adjusted to remove negative values and to smooth and scale the resulting curves. The sum of the individual curves at any given average household size is 1.</p>

<p>The 2012 Household Survey was used to estimate the share of households in each Household Size category by Life Cycle. The entire statewide database was used and aggregated to medium districts in order to obtain sufficient number of survey records in a group yet preserve a sufficient number of observations to estimate lookup curves by Life Cycle. The estimated Life Cycle curves were then used to weight the Household Size lookup curves derived from the Census data (termed “All Data” in the following figures) to obtain Household Size lookup curves by Life Cycle.</p>
