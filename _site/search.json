    "text": "Auto Ownership\nThe Auto Ownership model begins with the disaggregated households by TAZ and calculates how many vehicles each group owns. Households by vehicle ownership is grouped by 0, 1, 2, and 3+ vehicles. Auto ownership is based on utility functions for each combination of household size group, worker group, and income level (low/high). The utilities for each TAZ are then converted into probabilities. When the probabilities are multiplied by the associated number of households, then an auto ownership distribution by TAZ is created.\nThe utility functions for auto ownership contain a series of binary and linear variables. The binary variables are loop toggles that are set to 1 or 0 for household size groups, worker groups, and income levels. There are also two linear variables that are taken from TAZ attributes: population density of five nearest zones and employment within 30 minutes by transit. The coefficients for the utility function are shown in Table 1.\nThe code loops through the three groups to create utilities for each combination of binary variables for each TAZ. As can be seen in the table, for household size groups 5 and 6+, 3+ workers in a household, and high income, there are zero utility coefficients, which mean for combinations with these variables there is no utility. Additionally, the 3-vehicle utility is always set to 0 for every combination.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Coefficients for Vehicle Ownership Utility Functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n0-Vehicle Utility Function Coefficients\n1-Vehicle Utility Function Coefficients\n2-Vehicle Utility Function Coefficients\n3+-Vehicle Utility Function Coefficients\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n-5.007\n-2.185\n0.148\n0\n\n\nHousehold Size of 1\n3.671\n3.441\n0.951\n0\n\n\nHousehold Size of 2\n1.036\n1.016\n0.758\n0\n\n\nHousehold Size of 3\n0.186\n0.134\n-0.318\n0\n\n\nHousehold Size of 4\n0.001\n-0.738\n-0.793\n0\n\n\nHousehold Size of 5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nHousehold Size of 6+\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0 Worker in Household\n0.998\n0.514\n0\n0\n\n\n1 Workers in Household\n0\n0.552\n0.081\n0\n\n\n2 Workers in Household\n0\n0\n0.07\n0\n\n\n3+ Workers in Household\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nLow Income (Group 1)\n2.733\n1.557\n0.538\n0\n\n\nHigh Income (Group 2-4)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nPopulation Density of 5 nearest Zones\n0.05159\n0.07346\n0.02366\n0\n\n\nEmployment within 30 minutes by transit\n1.99e-05\n8.342e-06\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the utility values, probabilities for the vehicle ownership groups are calculated for each TAZ for each combination. The probability is the ratio of the exponential utility of each vehicle ownership group divided by the sum of the exponential utility of all three vehicle ownership groups for each combination. The vehicle ownership probabilities are multiplied by their associated household numbers as calculated in the household disaggregation script to get the number of households in each vehicle ownership group. Additionally, several aggregations are made to calculate total number of vehicles in different groupings. When calculating the number of vehicles in a 3+-vehicle group, the value of 3.5 number of vehicles per 3+ households is used.\n???Which validation charts should I add???"

    "text": "The Household Disaggregation model classifies a TAZ’s households by:\n\nHousehold Size\nIncome\nNumber of Workers\n\nHousehold Disaggregation is done in three steps with each step adding another level of disaggregation: estimating the distribution of households by size group, further disaggregation by income group and income level, and further disaggregation by number of workers per household. This results in 96 groupings when using the four income groups or 48 groupings when using low/high income levels.\nFor disaggregation to household size groups, the following lookup files contain the distribution of households across the six household size groups according the average household size for the three life cycle categories: Lookup - HH Size_LC1.csv, Lookup - HH Size_LC2.csv, and Lookup - HH Size_LC3.csv. The distributions in these files are grouped by county. There is also a third lookup file that contains a regional distribution used for comparison purposes: Lookup - HH Size.csv. When computing income ratios, the regional median household income of $74,946 (2019 dollars) is used from the latest ACS.\nFurther disaggregation by income groups is done in multiple steps. First a target TAZ distribution by income is calculated using a county distribution found in Lookup - Income.csv. Then a Fratar/Furness balancing method is used to get the matrix distribution across income groups and household sizes. The matrix is initialized with the values found in Table 1, which is hard-coded into the 2_HHDisaggregation.s script with the source being the 2012 Household Survey.

    "text": "A trip is defined as the movement of a person between two locations for a given purpose. Each trip has two trip ends. Each trip end is associated within a TAZ. Trips are comprised of a both a production zone and an attraction zone. The production zone is where the trip was produced, typically a household for a home-based trip or a place of employment for a non-home-based trip. The attraction zone is the location that is attracting a trip, typically a place of employment or commercial activity. Productions and attractions are travel direction agnostic, meaning that a to-work trip and from-work trip would show as two productions in the home location TAZ and as two attractions in the work location TAZ.\nThe Trip Generation script calculates productions and attractions at the TAZ level. The trip ends are not paired in this step but remain distinctly separated, which is then used as input into the Trip Distribution model that pairs trip ends together. The script calculates productions and attractions per zone using trip generation rates and adjustments. All values produced by this script represent person trips, not vehicle trips. The trip generation rates are calculated from the household travel survey.\nRates are applied to individual TAZs based on the attributes of the TAZ as taken from the household disaggregation model, additional socioeconomic data, externals data, and special generator data (Temple Square, SLC Main Library, colleges, etc.). All rates in this script are expressed in terms of daily rates. Rates are averages and are only applicable at aggregate levels.\nThe goal of the script is to generate a set of productions and attractions for each TAZ for the following base trip purposes:\n\nHome-Based Work (HBW)\nHome-Based School – Primary, Kindergarten to 6th Grade (HBSch_Pr)\nHome-Based School – Secondary, 7th to 12th Grade (HBSch_Sc)\nHome-Based Shopping (HBShp)\nHome-Based Other (HBOth)\nNon-Home-Based Work (NHBW)\nNon-Home-Based Non-Work (NHBNW)\n\nAdditionally, the script estimates trip generation for the following for external trips:\n\nInternal-to-External (IX) Productions\nExternal-to-Internal (XI) Attractions\n\nProductions and attractions are also generated for short-haul trucks based on people movement, goods movement, and services for the following truck types:\n\nLight Trucks (LT)\nMedium Trucks (MD)\nHeavy-Trucks (HV)\n\nGiven the various combinations of trip purposes and possible attributes, there are quite a few steps in the script. These steps can be grouped into the following three categories:\n\nEstimate productions\nEstimate attractions\nBalance productions and attractions\n\nFollowing a discussion of these three groups, there is a presentation of the validation results.\n\n\nProductions for each TAZ are estimated in the following steps:\n\nCalculate base productions\nCalculate internal-to-external productions and adjust base productions accordingly\nAdjust non-home-based trips to account for visitors\nCalculate productions for short haul truck trips\n\n\n\nBase productions are generated based on TAZ household attributes including number of workers, household size, and life cycle. Work trips only utilize attributes based on number of workers. The other trip purposes use household size and life cycle. The associated production rates are shown in Table 1. As expected, the greater the number of workers or the larger the household size, the higher the rates for any given trip purpose. The highest trip rate is 10.703 for home-based other trips for households of size 6+ in life cycle 2.\nThe production rates are only estimated for combinations of TAZ variable and trip purpose that are valid. A household with no workers does not generate any work trips. Additionally, households in Life Cycle 1 would not generate any school trips by definition.\n\n\nTable 1: Production Rates by Trip Purpose.\n\n\n\n\n(a) *HBSch productions for each TAZ are divided into HBSch_Pr and HBSch_Sc based on their respective regional shares of total enrollment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAZ Variable\nHBW\nHBSch*\nHBShp\nHBOth\nNHBW\nNHBNW\n\n\n\n\nHouseholds with 0 Workers\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nHouseholds with 1 Worker\n1.764\n-\n-\n-\n0.856\n-\n\n\nHouseholds with 2 Workers\n3.073\n-\n-\n-\n1.361\n-\n\n\nHouseholds with 3+ Workers\n4.698\n-\n-\n-\n1.781\n-\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 1 in Life Cycle 1\n-\n-\n0.443\n1.313\n-\n0.632\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 2 in Life Cycle 1\n-\n-\n0.706\n2.382\n-\n1.013\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 3 in Life Cycle 1\n-\n-\n0.757\n3.657\n-\n1.542\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 4 in Life Cycle 1\n-\n-\n1.088\n5.128\n-\n1.820\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 5 in Life Cycle 1\n-\n-\n1.548\n7.380\n-\n1.989\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 6+ in Life Cycle 1\n-\n-\n2.013\n9.643\n-\n2.159\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 1 in Life Cycle 2\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 2 in Life Cycle 2\n-\n0.530\n0.681\n2.508\n-\n1.499\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 3 in Life Cycle 2\n-\n0.675\n1.344\n4.437\n-\n1.738\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 4 in Life Cycle 2\n-\n1.117\n1.720\n6.115\n-\n2.618\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 5 in Life Cycle 2\n-\n2.473\n1.818\n8.310\n-\n3.282\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 6+ in Life Cycle 2\n-\n3.819\n1.916\n10.703\n-\n3.852\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 1 in Life Cycle 3\n-\n-\n0.561\n1.841\n-\n0.990\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 2 in Life Cycle 3\n-\n0.009\n1.149\n3.673\n-\n1.928\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 3 in Life Cycle 3\n-\n0.067\n1.272\n4.175\n-\n2.408\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 4 in Life Cycle 3\n-\n0.427\n1.404\n4.676\n-\n2.676\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 5 in Life Cycle 3\n-\n1.446\n1.683\n6.450\n-\n2.890\n\n\nHouseholds of Size 6+ in Life Cycle 3\n-\n2.865\n1.960\n8.958\n-\n2.997\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo calculate the total productions by trip purpose for each TAZ, the value of each variable is multiplied by the associated rate for that trip purpose and then summed over all the variables. Further division of Home-Based School trips into Primary and Secondary is done based on their respective regional shares of total enrollment. Productions for non-home-based trip purposes are further adjusted by the visitor adjustment factors in Table 2, which were taken from the 2012 Household Survey.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Visitor Adjustment Factors.\n\n\nTrip Purpose\nVisitor Adjustment Factor\n\n\n\n\nNHBW\n1.046\n\n\nNHBNW\n1.049\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProductions for internal-to-external (IX) trips are estimated by the model since the production occurs within the model space. The IX productions are taken as a share from the base productions and reassigned to the IX category. Ultimately, IX trips are not separated by trip purpose. But for the estimation of IX trip productions, trips are separated into two general trip purposes: work and non-work trips. Work trips include HBW. Non-Work trips include all other purposes except for school trips, which are excluded from external trips.\nThe share of productions that are IX work/non-work trips is shown in Table 3. Typically shares of productions are in the 1% to 4% range for all counties except Box Elder, which ranges from 5% to 20% of all trip productions being IX trips.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Internal-to-External Shares (2012 HH Survey)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty\nShare IX Work Productions\nShare IX Non-Work Productions\n\n\n\n\nBox Elder\n0.196\n0.052\n\n\nWeber\n0.035\n0.016\n\n\nDavis\n0.009\n0.011\n\n\nSalt Lake\n0.018\n0.015\n\n\nUtah\n0.017\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter calculating the number of IX productions using the share values, these trips are removed from the base productions. Additionally, since IX productions are in vehicle-trips the final step in calculating IX productions is to multiply the person trips by vehicle occupancy rate of 1.54.\nWhen calculating productions for the opposing direction, external-to-internal (XI), the TAZ values come directly from the External_TripEnds.dbf file as generated in the Input Processing scripts.\n\n\n\nShort-Haul truck productions are calculated as a function of ecommerce variables, residential variables, and employment variables that vary by truck type. The overall formula used to calculate truck productions is as follows,\nEquation 1: Short-Haul Truck Productions \\[{Good\\_p}_{TR} = Share\\_Ecom_{TR} * (ResRate_{TR} * TOTHH * Fac\\_ECom\\_HH_{TR} + EmpRate_{TR} * TOTEMP * Fac\\_ECom\\_Emp_{TR}) + (1 - Share\\_ECom_{TR}) * (ResRate_{TR} * TOTHH)\n\\]\nwhere,\n\nTR represents truck type (light, medium, or heavy),\nShare_ECom represents the proportion of truck trips that apply to eCommerce factors (See Table 4),\nResRate represents the residential variable (See Table 4),\nEmpRate represents the employment variable (See Table 4),\nTOTHH represents the total number of households in a given TAZ,\nTOTEMP represents the total employment in a given TAZ,\nFac_ECom_HH represents the ecommerce factor applied to households (See Table 5),\nand FAC_ECom_Emp represents the ecommerce factor applied to employment (See Table 5).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Proportion of Truck Trips to apply E-Commerce Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nLight Truck Factor\nMedium Truck Factor\nHeavy Truck Factor\n\n\n\n\nShare_Ecom\n0.55\n0.8\n0.8\n\n\nResRate\n0.74745\n0.44427\n0.17481\n\n\nEmpRate\n0.25703\n0.1875\n0.11021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fac_ECom_HH variable corresponds to the values in the Households rows in Table 5.

These adjustments are made at the three main groupings for short-haul productions and are shown in Table 6. A factor of 1 means there is no adjustment.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: General Short Haul Truck Production/Attraction Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort-Haul Truck Category\nLight Truck Factor\nMedium Truck Factor\nHeavy Truck Factor\n\n\n\n\nPeople\n1.8\n1.85\n1.65\n\n\nGoods\n1.8\n1.85\n1.65\n\n\nServices\n1.8\n1.85\n1.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trip Generation script estimates attractions for all trip purposes. Attractions are defined as the end of the trip that is serving as the attraction for a trip. For home-based trips (trips produced at a home location), attractions could include work locations, retail centers, restaurants, schools, colleges, etc. For non-home-based trips (trips produced at work or another locations), attractions could include delivery locations, restaurants, etc. The attractions for each TAZ are estimated in the following steps:\n\nCalculate base attractions.\nCalculate telecommuting attractions.\nCalculate external-to-internal attractions and adjust base productions accordingly.\nAdjust attractions based on CBD or area type.\nAdjust truck attraction based on county.\nCalculate attractions for short haul truck trips.\nCalculate attraction adjustments for special generators.\n\n\n\nAttractions are generated based on TAZ employment, enrollment, and household attributes. Whereas productions were mostly based on household attributes, attractions are primarily based on employment for most trip purposes with exceptions for HBSch that is based on enrollment and for HBOth, NHBW, and NHBNW with some household attractions. Attraction rates are shown in Table 7.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Attraction Rates by Trip Purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAZ Variable Description\nTAZ Variable\nHBW\nHBSch_Pr\nHBSch_Sc\nHBShp\nHBOth\nNHBW\nNHBNW\n\n\n\n\nRetail Employment\nRETL\n0.957\n-\n-\n3.660\n-\n1.132\n3.419\n\n\nFood Employment\nFOOD\n1.017\n-\n-\n3.058\n-\n1.620\n3.264\n\n\nManufacturing Employment\nMANU\n1.136\n-\n-\n-\n0.019\n0.231\n0.037\n\n\nWholesale Employment\nWSLE\n1.136\n-\n-\n-\n0.126\n0.410\n0.103\n\n\nOffice Employment\nOFFI\n1.196\n-\n-\n-\n0.219\n0.178\n0.054\n\n\nGov./Ed.

Work-at-home jobs (HBJ) are added back into each employment category for the attraction calculations when calculating telecommuting. Telecommuting attractions are specified as either home-based work or non home-based work. Table 8 shows the rates applied to each job portion of the telecommutting function.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: Telecommuting Rates applied to each Job portion of the Telecommuting Function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Type\nFactor for HBW Telecommuting\nFactor for NHBW Telecommuting\n\n\n\n\nRETL\n0.957\n1.132\n\n\nFOOD\n1.017\n1.62\n\n\nMANU\n1.136\n0.231\n\n\nWSLE\n1.136\n0.41\n\n\nOFFI\n1.196\n0.178\n\n\nGVED\n1.196\n0.25\n\n\nHLTH\n1.136\n0.185\n\n\nOTHR\n1.136\n0.2\n\n\nAGRI\n1.136\n0.2\n\n\nMING\n1.136\n0.2\n\n\nCONS\n1.136\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor performing scenario testing, the 1ControlCenter.block file for the model scenario contains a telecommuting factor that serves as a multiplier to all employment-based telecommuting calculations. The default value for this factor is 1. A value less than 1 decreases the telecommuting share and a value greater than 1 increases the telecommuting share.\nAn additional adjustment factor is used during the calibration process to further tune the model results for telecommuting to match the base year target. This model uses a telecommuting calibration factor of 1.\n\n\n\nThe TAZ attractions for external-to-internal (XI) attractions is set to the number of total households (TOTHH) plus the total employment (TOTEMP). Since XI attractions are scaled to match productions, this means that XI attractions will be proportionally distributed by households plus employment amongst all TAZs.\nAdditional adjustment factors applied to XI attractions include county factors and a scaling factor. The county adjustment factors are shown in Table 9. The scaling factor used for the model is 0.010957.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9: IX Attraction County Adjustment Factors\n\n\nJob Type\nXI Adjustment Factor\n\n\n\n\nBox Elder\n8.5741\n\n\nWeber\n1.0061\n\n\nDavis\n0.5437\n\n\nSalt Lake\n0.9974\n\n\nUtah\n0.8972\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen calculating attractions for the opposing direction, internal-to-external (IX), the values come directly from the External_TripEnds.dbf file as generated in the Input Processing scripts.\n\n\n\nSome trip purposed are further adjusted by select geographies. This allows for localized nuances to be applied when attraction rates may be atypical of regional rates. Two sets of adjustments are made. First, an adjustment of 0.5 is made to home-based shopping trips attracted to the CBD in Salt Lake County. Thus, shopping trips attracted to the CBD are half of what a non-CBD rate would be. Second, there are adjustments based on select area types for Davis and Salt Lake Counties. These adjustments are shown in Table 10. Attractions for urban area types are reduced 70% to 80% for select trip purposes. For CBD-like area types in Salt Lake County, there is an increase of 25% for home-based work trips showing a greater number of attractions compared as compared to similar areas in the rest of the region.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10: Adjustment Factors for Select Counties/Area Types\n\n\nCounty\nArea Type\nHBW\nHBShp\nHBOth\nNHBNW\n\n\n\n\nDavis\nUrban\n0.8\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nSalt Lake\nUrban\n-\n0.75\n0.7\n0.8\n\n\nSalt Lake\nCBD-Like\n1.25\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn additional adjustment factor is used during the calibration process to further tune the model results for medium and heavy trucks to match observed truck traffic. These adjustments are made at the three main groupings for short-haul attractions. Light trucks were low in Box Elder, Weber, Davis, and Utah County and high in Salt Lake county. Medium trucks were low in Box Elder and Davis county and high in Weber, Salt Lake, and Utah county. Heavy trucks were low in Box Elder, Davis, and Utah county and high in Weber and Salt Lake County. The factors as shown in Table 11 were set to help offset these differences.\n\n\n\n\nTable 11: Area Specific Short Haul Truck Production/Attraction Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort-Haul Truck Category\nArea\nLight Truck Factor\nMedium Truck Factor\nHeavy Truck Factor\n\n\n\n\nPeople\nUrban Spaces\n1.03\n0.9\n0.9\n\n\nGoods\nUrban Spaces\n1.03\n0.9\n0.9\n\n\nServices\nUrban Spaces\n1.03\n0.9\n0.9\n\n\nPeople\nBox Elder\n1.5\n1.17\n1.12\n\n\nGoods\nBox Elder\n1.5\n1.17\n1.12\n\n\nServices\nBox Elder\n1.5\n1.17\n1.12\n\n\nPeople\nWeber\n1.22\n0.96\n0.96\n\n\nGoods\nWeber\n1.22\n0.96\n0.96\n\n\nServices\nWeber\n1.22\n0.96\n0.96\n\n\nPeople\nDavis\n1.14\n1.08\n1.1\n\n\nGoods\nDavis\n1.14\n1.08\n1.1\n\n\nServices\nDavis\n1.14\n1.08\n1.1\n\n\nPeople\nSalt Lake\n0.59\n0.62\n0.54\n\n\nGoods\nSalt Lake\n0.59\n0.62\n0.54\n\n\nServices\nSalt Lake\n0.59\n0.62\n0.54\n\n\nPeople\nUtah\n1.19\n0.95\n1.01\n\n\nGoods\nUtah\n1.19\n0.95\n1.01\n\n\nServices\nUtah\n1.19\n0.95\n1.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two groups of special generators that have adjustments for trip attractions. Temple Square and the SLC Library are in one group and colleges are in another.\n\n\nTrip attractions for Temple Square and the SLC Library are generated using a base year daily visitation numbers and then increasing by an annual growth rate to estimate trip ends in the model year. The values used for estimation are shown in Table 12. Temple Square had an estimated five million visitors in 2013, which translates to roughly 13,700 visitors per day and 27,400 trip ends per day. The SLC library is the second most popular destination in Salt Lake with approximately four million visitors per year or roughly 11,000 visitors and 22,000 trip ends per day.\n\n\n\n\nTable 12: Adjustment Factors for Select Counties/Area Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Generator\nBase Year\nBase Year Daily Trip Ends\nAnnual Growth Rate\n\n\n\n\nTemple Square\n2013\n27400\n1.0%\n\n\nSLC Library\n2005\n22000\n1.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter calculating model year attractions for the two special generators, the total attractions are then added to TAZ attractions proportionally amongst the trip purposes HBOth and NHBNW for the TAZ including Temple Square and HBOth, NHBW, and NHBNW for the TAZ including SLC Library.\n\n\n\nCHECK ENTIRE SECTION - we updated this but I forgot what we did - ask bill There are several locations with the TDM where trips to and from colleges are estimated. Home-based college (HBC) trips are separately generated and distributed as part of the Input Processing scripts and are found in TripTable.mtx. HBC trips are those of enrolled students traveling to and from campus. These trips bypass Trip Generation and Trip Distribution scripts. The attractions for other trip purposes to colleges are generated together with the other trips within the containing TAZ. Adjustments are then made to account for additional attractions to colleges for the three trip purposes of HBOth, NHBW, and NHBNW.\nHBOth, NHBNW, and NHBNW trip adjustments are calculated through the following steps:\n\nCalculate the number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) students per campus by multiplying the enrollment control total for a college campus from TripTableControlTotal.csv by the FTE rate for the college campus from College_Factors.csv.\nCalculate the total attractions that should be generated based on the number of FTE students. This is done by multiplying the number of FTE students (step 1) by 2.4 vehicle attractions per student (based on all purposes from ITE, exact reference not included) multiplied by 1.7 person trips to vehicle trips (source not stated, is it the HHSurvey??).\nCalculate HBW trips associated with college campus in its containing TAZ with the following steps:\n\nMultiply FTE students (step 1) by the college employment factor (see Table 13) to get the estimated number of employees for a college campus.\nDivide the estimated number of employees for a college campus by the total employment (TOTEMP) for the containing TAZ to obtain a college employment ratio. The ratio is capped at 1.0.\nThe college employment ratio is then multiplied by the number of HBW trips to determine which portion of HBW are associated with the college.\n\nCalculate the number of non-HBC/HBW attractions to add to the TAZ by subtracting the college associated HBW trips (step 3) and HBC trips (TripTable.mtx) from the total attractions (step 2).\nDistribute the additional attractions (step 4) proportionally amongst HBOth, NHBW, and NHBNW.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 13: College Employment Factors\n\n\nCollege\nCollege Employment Factor\n\n\n\n\nWeber State University\n0.25\n\n\nUtah Valley University\n0.25\n\n\nSalt Lake Community College\n0.29\n\n\nLDSBC\n0.33\n\n\nWestminster\n0.33\n\n\nUniversity of Utah\n0.71\n\n\nBrigham Young University\n0.71\n\n\nUnspecified\n0.48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final step of Trip Generation is to balance the productions and attractions. Balancing takes place by proportionally increasing or decreasing productions/attractions across the entire model space to match regional totals. For trips internal to the model space (non-externals) the attractions are balanced to match the productions. External trip productions and attractions are balanced in the WFRC/MAG model space. The IX productions are balanced to the IX attractions and the XI attractions are balanced to the XI productions. Truck trips are already balanced since TAZ attractions were set equal TAZ productions. –really?\nThere is also an important distinction to be understood regarding non-home-based trips. While non-home-based productions are based on household characteristics of a TAZ, the trips are not actually being produced in the home TAZ location. They are produced at another location, hence the term non-home-based. Non-home-based productions, thus, are only used to get total values that are then used to balance non-home-based attractions.

Work trips only utilize attributes based on number of workers. The other trip purposes use household size and life cycle. The associated production rates are shown in Table 1.

The highest trip rate is 10.703 for home-based other trips for households of size 6+ in life cycle 2.\nThe production rates are only estimated for combinations of TAZ variable and trip purpose that are valid.

Further division of Home-Based School trips into Primary and Secondary is done based on their respective regional shares of total enrollment. Productions for non-home-based trip purposes are further adjusted by the visitor adjustment factors in Table 2, which were taken from the 2012 Household Survey.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Visitor Adjustment Factors.\n\n\nTrip Purpose\nVisitor Adjustment Factor\n\n\n\n\nNHBW\n1.046\n\n\nNHBNW\n1.049\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProductions for internal-to-external (IX) trips are estimated by the model since the production occurs within the model space. The IX productions are taken as a share from the base productions and reassigned to the IX category. Ultimately, IX trips are not separated by trip purpose. But for the estimation of IX trip productions, trips are separated into two general trip purposes: work and non-work trips. Work trips include HBW. Non-Work trips include all other purposes except for school trips, which are excluded from external trips.\nThe share of productions that are IX work/non-work trips is shown in Table 3. Typically shares of productions are in the 1% to 4% range for all counties except Box Elder, which ranges from 5% to 20% of all trip productions being IX trips.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Internal-to-External Shares (2012 HH Survey)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty\nShare IX Work Productions\nShare IX Non-Work Productions\n\n\n\n\nBox Elder\n0.196\n0.052\n\n\nWeber\n0.035\n0.016\n\n\nDavis\n0.009\n0.011\n\n\nSalt Lake\n0.018\n0.015\n\n\nUtah\n0.017\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter calculating the number of IX productions using the share values, these trips are removed from the base productions. Additionally, since IX productions are in vehicle-trips the final step in calculating IX productions is to multiply the person trips by vehicle occupancy rate of 1.54.\nWhen calculating productions for the opposing direction, external-to-internal (XI), the TAZ values come directly from the External_TripEnds.dbf file as generated in the Input Processing scripts.\n\n\n\nShort-Haul truck productions are calculated as a function of ecommerce variables, residential variables, and employment variables that vary by truck type. The overall formula used to calculate truck productions is as follows,\nEquation 1: Short-Haul Truck Productions \\[{Good\\_p}_{TR} = Share\\_Ecom_{TR} * (ResRate_{TR} * TOTHH * Fac\\_ECom\\_HH_{TR} + EmpRate_{TR} * TOTEMP * Fac\\_ECom\\_Emp_{TR}) + (1 - Share\\_ECom_{TR}) * (ResRate_{TR} * TOTHH)\n\\]\nwhere,\n\nTR represents truck type (light, medium, or heavy),\nShare_ECom represents the proportion of truck trips that apply to eCommerce factors (See Table 4),\nResRate represents the residential variable (See Table 4),\nEmpRate represents the employment variable (See Table 4),\nTOTHH represents the total number of households in a given TAZ,\nTOTEMP represents the total employment in a given TAZ,\nFac_ECom_HH represents the ecommerce factor applied to households (See Table 5),\nand FAC_ECom_Emp represents the ecommerce factor applied to employment (See Table 5).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Proportion of Truck Trips to apply E-Commerce Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nLight Truck Factor\nMedium Truck Factor\nHeavy Truck Factor\n\n\n\n\nShare_Ecom\n0.55\n0.8\n0.8\n\n\nResRate\n0.74745\n0.44427\n0.17481\n\n\nEmpRate\n0.25703\n0.1875\n0.11021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fac_ECom_HH variable corresponds to the values in the Households rows in Table 5.

    "text": "The Trip Generation script estimates attractions for all trip purposes. Attractions are defined as the end of the trip that is serving as the attraction for a trip. For home-based trips (trips produced at a home location), attractions could include work locations, retail centers, restaurants, schools, colleges, etc. For non-home-based trips (trips produced at work or another locations), attractions could include delivery locations, restaurants, etc. The attractions for each TAZ are estimated in the following steps:\n\nCalculate base attractions.\nCalculate telecommuting attractions.\nCalculate external-to-internal attractions and adjust base productions accordingly.\nAdjust attractions based on CBD or area type.\nAdjust truck attraction based on county.\nCalculate attractions for short haul truck trips.\nCalculate attraction adjustments for special generators.\n\n\n\nAttractions are generated based on TAZ employment, enrollment, and household attributes. Whereas productions were mostly based on household attributes, attractions are primarily based on employment for most trip purposes with exceptions for HBSch that is based on enrollment and for HBOth, NHBW, and NHBNW with some household attractions.

Work-at-home jobs (HBJ) are added back into each employment category for the attraction calculations when calculating telecommuting. Telecommuting attractions are specified as either home-based work or non home-based work. Table 8 shows the rates applied to each job portion of the telecommutting function.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: Telecommuting Rates applied to each Job portion of the Telecommuting Function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Type\nFactor for HBW Telecommuting\nFactor for NHBW Telecommuting\n\n\n\n\nRETL\n0.957\n1.132\n\n\nFOOD\n1.017\n1.62\n\n\nMANU\n1.136\n0.231\n\n\nWSLE\n1.136\n0.41\n\n\nOFFI\n1.196\n0.178\n\n\nGVED\n1.196\n0.25\n\n\nHLTH\n1.136\n0.185\n\n\nOTHR\n1.136\n0.2\n\n\nAGRI\n1.136\n0.2\n\n\nMING\n1.136\n0.2\n\n\nCONS\n1.136\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor performing scenario testing, the 1ControlCenter.block file for the model scenario contains a telecommuting factor that serves as a multiplier to all employment-based telecommuting calculations. The default value for this factor is 1. A value less than 1 decreases the telecommuting share and a value greater than 1 increases the telecommuting share.\nAn additional adjustment factor is used during the calibration process to further tune the model results for telecommuting to match the base year target. This model uses a telecommuting calibration factor of 1.\n\n\n\nThe TAZ attractions for external-to-internal (XI) attractions is set to the number of total households (TOTHH) plus the total employment (TOTEMP). Since XI attractions are scaled to match productions, this means that XI attractions will be proportionally distributed by households plus employment amongst all TAZs.\nAdditional adjustment factors applied to XI attractions include county factors and a scaling factor. The county adjustment factors are shown in Table 9. The scaling factor used for the model is 0.010957.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9: IX Attraction County Adjustment Factors\n\n\nJob Type\nXI Adjustment Factor\n\n\n\n\nBox Elder\n8.5741\n\n\nWeber\n1.0061\n\n\nDavis\n0.5437\n\n\nSalt Lake\n0.9974\n\n\nUtah\n0.8972\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen calculating attractions for the opposing direction, internal-to-external (IX), the values come directly from the External_TripEnds.dbf file as generated in the Input Processing scripts.\n\n\n\nSome trip purposed are further adjusted by select geographies. This allows for localized nuances to be applied when attraction rates may be atypical of regional rates. Two sets of adjustments are made. First, an adjustment of 0.5 is made to home-based shopping trips attracted to the CBD in Salt Lake County. Thus, shopping trips attracted to the CBD are half of what a non-CBD rate would be. Second, there are adjustments based on select area types for Davis and Salt Lake Counties. These adjustments are shown in Table 10. Attractions for urban area types are reduced 70% to 80% for select trip purposes. For CBD-like area types in Salt Lake County, there is an increase of 25% for home-based work trips showing a greater number of attractions compared as compared to similar areas in the rest of the region.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10: Adjustment Factors for Select Counties/Area Types\n\n\nCounty\nArea Type\nHBW\nHBShp\nHBOth\nNHBNW\n\n\n\n\nDavis\nUrban\n0.8\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nSalt Lake\nUrban\n-\n0.75\n0.7\n0.8\n\n\nSalt Lake\nCBD-Like\n1.25\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn additional adjustment factor is used during the calibration process to further tune the model results for medium and heavy trucks to match observed truck traffic. These adjustments are made at the three main groupings for short-haul attractions. Light trucks were low in Box Elder, Weber, Davis, and Utah County and high in Salt Lake county. Medium trucks were low in Box Elder and Davis county and high in Weber, Salt Lake, and Utah county. Heavy trucks were low in Box Elder, Davis, and Utah county and high in Weber and Salt Lake County.

Temple Square and the SLC Library are in one group and colleges are in another.\n\n\nTrip attractions for Temple Square and the SLC Library are generated using a base year daily visitation numbers and then increasing by an annual growth rate to estimate trip ends in the model year. The values used for estimation are shown in Table 12. Temple Square had an estimated five million visitors in 2013, which translates to roughly 13,700 visitors per day and 27,400 trip ends per day. The SLC library is the second most popular destination in Salt Lake with approximately four million visitors per year or roughly 11,000 visitors and 22,000 trip ends per day.\n\n\n\n\nTable 12: Adjustment Factors for Select Counties/Area Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Generator\nBase Year\nBase Year Daily Trip Ends\nAnnual Growth Rate\n\n\n\n\nTemple Square\n2013\n27400\n1.0%\n\n\nSLC Library\n2005\n22000\n1.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter calculating model year attractions for the two special generators, the total attractions are then added to TAZ attractions proportionally amongst the trip purposes HBOth and NHBNW for the TAZ including Temple Square and HBOth, NHBW, and NHBNW for the TAZ including SLC Library.\n\n\n\nCHECK ENTIRE SECTION - we updated this but I forgot what we did - ask bill There are several locations with the TDM where trips to and from colleges are estimated. Home-based college (HBC) trips are separately generated and distributed as part of the Input Processing scripts and are found in TripTable.mtx. HBC trips are those of enrolled students traveling to and from campus. These trips bypass Trip Generation and Trip Distribution scripts. The attractions for other trip purposes to colleges are generated together with the other trips within the containing TAZ. Adjustments are then made to account for additional attractions to colleges for the three trip purposes of HBOth, NHBW, and NHBNW.\nHBOth, NHBNW, and NHBNW trip adjustments are calculated through the following steps:\n\nCalculate the number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) students per campus by multiplying the enrollment control total for a college campus from TripTableControlTotal.csv by the FTE rate for the college campus from College_Factors.csv.\nCalculate the total attractions that should be generated based on the number of FTE students. This is done by multiplying the number of FTE students (step 1) by 2.4 vehicle attractions per student (based on all purposes from ITE, exact reference not included) multiplied by 1.7 person trips to vehicle trips (source not stated, is it the HHSurvey??).\nCalculate HBW trips associated with college campus in its containing TAZ with the following steps:\n\nMultiply FTE students (step 1) by the college employment factor (see Table 13) to get the estimated number of employees for a college campus.\nDivide the estimated number of employees for a college campus by the total employment (TOTEMP) for the containing TAZ to obtain a college employment ratio. The ratio is capped at 1.0.\nThe college employment ratio is then multiplied by the number of HBW trips to determine which portion of HBW are associated with the college.\n\nCalculate the number of non-HBC/HBW attractions to add to the TAZ by subtracting the college associated HBW trips (step 3) and HBC trips (TripTable.mtx) from the total attractions (step 2).\nDistribute the additional attractions (step 4) proportionally amongst HBOth, NHBW, and NHBNW.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 13: College Employment Factors\n\n\nCollege\nCollege Employment Factor\n\n\n\n\nWeber State University\n0.25\n\n\nUtah Valley University\n0.25\n\n\nSalt Lake Community College\n0.29\n\n\nLDSBC\n0.33\n\n\nWestminster\n0.33\n\n\nUniversity of Utah\n0.71\n\n\nBrigham Young University\n0.71\n\n\nUnspecified\n0.48"

    "text": "The final step of Trip Generation is to balance the productions and attractions. Balancing takes place by proportionally increasing or decreasing productions/attractions across the entire model space to match regional totals. For trips internal to the model space (non-externals) the attractions are balanced to match the productions. External trip productions and attractions are balanced in the WFRC/MAG model space. The IX productions are balanced to the IX attractions and the XI attractions are balanced to the XI productions. Truck trips are already balanced since TAZ attractions were set equal TAZ productions. –really?\nThere is also an important distinction to be understood regarding non-home-based trips. While non-home-based productions are based on household characteristics of a TAZ, the trips are not actually being produced in the home TAZ location. They are produced at another location, hence the term non-home-based. Non-home-based productions, thus, are only used to get total values that are then used to balance non-home-based attractions. After attractions are balanced to match productions, TAZ productions are set equal to TAZ attractions. So, non-home-based productions are used to get the quantity of trips, but attractions are used to get the distribution of trips."

ATO metrics quantify how well the current and future transportation system work with land use. Both shorter travel times and an increased presence of employment and other opportunities result in higher accessibility scores.\nA script to calculate ATO metrics, 1_Access_to_Opportunity.s located in the 2_ModelScripts\\7_PostProcessing folder, has been added to the model’s _HailMary.s batch script and runs automatically with every model run. The script sums the number of jobs and households that are within a typical commute travel shed (in minutes) by auto and transit. The typical commute travel shed is defined using a distance decay curve estimated from the 2012 household travel survey. Metrics that combine the jobs and households are also calculated.\nResults from the ATO script are output into 7_PostProcessing\\Access_to_Opportunity_@DemographicYear@.dbf. Results can be joined with the TAZ shapefile to visualize the data, such as is shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.\n??? Using the CompJobHHByTran and CompJobHHByAuto fields…is that right???&lt;/mark\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Access to opportunity by auto mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Access to opportunity by transit mode."

CRT boardings were found to be higher than observed for Davis County and lower than observed for Utah County. An adjustment of 5 additional minutes to in-vehicle-time for trips to/from Davis County and 5 fewer minute to in-vehicle-time for Utah County was made to attempt to bring the model more in-line with observations. ???VERIFY!!!???\nAdditional investigation was conducted into why Provo and Lehi were particularly low in the model. The findings did not turn up any obvious errors in the transit or model network. So, the conclusion is that further adjustments to CRT will be possible in the Mode Choice Update project that is currently being undertaken for the next release of the model.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 8: 2019 Daily CRT Boardings by Station - Model vs Observed"

    "text": "Miscellaneous Changes\nA small bug was fixed in the ‘1_TripTable.s’ script in the ‘2_ModelScripts\\0_InputProcessing\\d_TripTable’ folder. The control totals for the Salt Lake International Airport and Lagoon zones were being assigned to the other location’s output. This fix will cause a localized change to the volumes near the airport and Lagoon.\nA small bug fix was made to the ‘1_NetProcessor.s’ script in the ‘2_ModelScripts\\0_InputProcessing\\ c_NetworkProcessing’ folder. When socioeconomic data is loaded on to the TAZ centroids, home-based job employment had supplanted the construction job variable. This fix only affects labeling of socioeconomic data on the highway network in Cube and does not affect any travel model results.\nTIME fields on the network were edited to have four decimal places of precision instead of two (added to improve speed calculations). Subfolder structure was removed for ‘0_DeleteTempFiles.s’ script in ‘2_ModelScripts\\7_PostProcessing’ folder and corresponding edits were made in the ’_HailMary.s’ batch script.\n’_HailMary.s’ was updated to include more detail in the email functions. The ‘Compare2Assignments.s’ script in the ‘2_ModelScripts\\7_PostProcessing\\2_Compare2Nets’ folder was updated to include SEGID, correct field names for free flow speed, and add Area Type comparison. The associated DEFAULT.VPR file was also cleaned up. A script to compare two master networks, ‘Compare_MasterNet.s’, was also added to the ‘2_ModelScripts\\7_PostProcessing\\2_Compare2Nets’ folder."

Because the networks reflect the “official” MAG amended plan, the travel model was reissued with a new date stamp. However, since there were no changes to the model itself or the other modeling inputs, the version number of the travel model remained the same.\nFigure 1 shows where lanes were added (green) or were taken away (orange) between ‘WF TDM v8.3.1 - 2020-05-08’ and ‘WF TDM v8.3.1 - 2020-08-17’ highway networks.

    "text": "Model Results - Comparison with v8.3.1\nFigure 1 shows a comparison of daily roadway volume in the v8.3.2 model compared to the v8.3.1 model. Roadway links in red demonstrate an increase in traffic and green show a decrease in traffic between the new and the old model. The thicker the line and darker the color, the greater the magnitude of change. At the region level, the changes show that v.8.3.2 includes greater county-to-county flows as demonstrated in the 2019 base year with volume between Salt Lake County and both Davis and Utah Counties increasing while roadways such as I-80, I-215, and SR-201 showing decreasing traffic. This pattern is continued in the 2050 model with the intensity of change increasing on north/south freeways and arterials.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Model Daily Volumes Comparison (v8.3.2 vs v8.3.1).\n\n\nComparison of the highway volume validations of the v8.3.2 and v8.3.1 models are shown in Figure 2. There are separate charts by facility type and by county, as well as vehicle type. Medium and heavy truck trip generations and trip-length-frequencies were adjusted in the calibration process to bring model truck volumes closer in line with observed. Overall, for all vehicles the v8.3.2 model is closer to observed with all facility types within 4% of observed. Utah County improves significantly to only 1% low while Box Elder, Weber, and Davis counties are a couple percent lower than v8.3.1. When looked at by facility type, medium and heavy trucks see major improvements with minor arterials and major collectors and are much closer to observed by significant margins, but overall are slightly lower than observed as compared to v8.3.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Highway Volumes Validation (v8.3.2 and v8.3.1).\n\n\nFigure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5 show a comparison between daily model volumes by vehicle type with observed traffic volumes. There are slight changes in the All Vehicles figures between v8.3.2 and v8.3.1. Greater improvements are seen in the Medium and Heavy Truck figures, especially in the Box Elder and the Mountain View Corridor areas.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: All Vehicles Daily Volumes Comparison (Model vs Observed).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Medium Trucks Daily Volumes Comparison (Model vs Observed).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Heavy Trucks Daily Volumes Comparison (Model vs Observed)\n\n\nTransit ridership between v8.3.1 and v8.3.1 were compared at the trips, boardings, and mode share levels. Figure 6 and Figure 7 show a comparison of daily transit ridership and boardings for both the v8.3.2 and the v8.3.1 models. The v8.3.1 and v8.3.2 model transit was calibrated to the UTA On-Board Survey for 2015 and 2019, respectively, so the ridership for each of those models falls right on the OBS target. The boardings for the model are estimated but are close to average annual boardings as reported by UTA. Boardings between 2015 and 2019 have been relatively flat. The increase to 2050 is based on increased transit attractiveness and more supportive land use as built into the model.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Daily Transit Ridership - All Modes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Daily Boardings - All Modes.\n\n\nShare by transit mode is shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 for v8.3.2 and v8.3.1, respectively. In v8.3.2, Core Bus routes (Mode 5) show a greater portion of trips in v8.3.2 than in v8.3.1. These additional trips come mostly from Light Rail, which actually sees a decrease in mode share in 2030. Commuter Rail shares remain relatively consistent, as well as BRT.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Share by Transit Mode – v8.3.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Share by Transit Mode – v8.3.1.\n\n\nEven though the transit ridership forecasts are lower by 23% in v8.3.2 compared to v8.3.1, the 2019 to 2050 ratios for each model are similar with 2.0 in v8.3.2 and 2.2 in v8.3.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Comparison of 2019 and 2050 ratios.\n\n\nAs mentioned in a previous section, county-level adjustments were made in Davis and Utah counties to help better align station boardings in the model with observed. The comparison of the models with observed is shown in Figure 11. Due to these adjustments, there is a slight increase in Utah County boardings. However, Provo Station decreased slightly to just over half of what is observed. Davis County boardings proved to be more sensitive to the adjustment and a significant decrease is shown but still higher than observed boardings.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: 2019 Daily FrontRunner Boardings by Station Compared to Observed."

Davis County boardings were significantly higher than observed, while Utah County boardings were significantly lower. A +15 multiplier of initial in-vehicle time penalty was added to all stations in Davis County, while -15 multiplier of in-vehicle time was added to all stations in Utah County.
