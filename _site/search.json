    "text": "Model Results - Comparison with v8.3.1\nFigure 1 shows a comparison of daily roadway volume in the v8.3.2 model compared to the v8.3.1 model. Roadway links in red demonstrate an increase in traffic and green show a decrease in traffic between the new and the old model. The thicker the line and darker the color, the greater the magnitude of change. At the region level, the changes show that v.8.3.2 includes greater county-to-county flows as demonstrated in the 2019 base year with volume between Salt Lake County and both Davis and Utah Counties increasing while roadways such as I-80, I-215, and SR-201 showing decreasing traffic. This pattern is continued in the 2050 model with the intensity of change increasing on north/south freeways and arterials.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Model Daily Volumes Comparison (v8.3.2 vs v8.3.1).\n\n\nComparison of the highway volume validations of the v8.3.2 and v8.3.1 models are shown in Figure 2. There are separate charts by facility type and by county, as well as vehicle type. Medium and heavy truck trip generations and trip-length-frequencies were adjusted in the calibration process to bring model truck volumes closer in line with observed. Overall, for all vehicles the v8.3.2 model is closer to observed with all facility types within 4% of observed. Utah County improves significantly to only 1% low while Box Elder, Weber, and Davis counties are a couple percent lower than v8.3.1. When looked at by facility type, medium and heavy trucks see major improvements with minor arterials and major collectors and are much closer to observed by significant margins, but overall are slightly lower than observed as compared to v8.3.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Highway Volumes Validation (v8.3.2 and v8.3.1).\n\n\nFigure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5 show a comparison between daily model volumes by vehicle type with observed traffic volumes. There are slight changes in the All Vehicles figures between v8.3.2 and v8.3.1. Greater improvements are seen in the Medium and Heavy Truck figures, especially in the Box Elder and the Mountain View Corridor areas.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: All Vehicles Daily Volumes Comparison (Model vs Observed).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Medium Trucks Daily Volumes Comparison (Model vs Observed).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Heavy Trucks Daily Volumes Comparison (Model vs Observed)\n\n\nTransit ridership between v8.3.1 and v8.3.1 were compared at the trips, boardings, and mode share levels. Figure 6 and Figure 7 show a comparison of daily transit ridership and boardings for both the v8.3.2 and the v8.3.1 models. The v8.3.1 and v8.3.2 model transit was calibrated to the UTA On-Board Survey for 2015 and 2019, respectively, so the ridership for each of those models falls right on the OBS target. The boardings for the model are estimated but are close to average annual boardings as reported by UTA. Boardings between 2015 and 2019 have been relatively flat. The increase to 2050 is based on increased transit attractiveness and more supportive land use as built into the model.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Daily Transit Ridership - All Modes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Daily Boardings - All Modes.\n\n\nShare by transit mode is shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 for v8.3.2 and v8.3.1, respectively. In v8.3.2, Core Bus routes (Mode 5) show a greater portion of trips in v8.3.2 than in v8.3.1. These additional trips come mostly from Light Rail, which actually sees a decrease in mode share in 2030. Commuter Rail shares remain relatively consistent, as well as BRT.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Share by Transit Mode – v8.3.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Share by Transit Mode – v8.3.1.\n\n\nEven though the transit ridership forecasts are lower by 23% in v8.3.2 compared to v8.3.1, the 2019 to 2050 ratios for each model are similar with 2.0 in v8.3.2 and 2.2 in v8.3.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Comparison of 2019 and 2050 ratios.\n\n\nAs mentioned in a previous section, county-level adjustments were made in Davis and Utah counties to help better align station boardings in the model with observed. The comparison of the models with observed is shown in Figure 11. Due to these adjustments, there is a slight increase in Utah County boardings. However, Provo Station decreased slightly to just over half of what is observed. Davis County boardings proved to be more sensitive to the adjustment and a significant decrease is shown but still higher than observed boardings.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: 2019 Daily FrontRunner Boardings by Station Compared to Observed."

Additional edits were made in the MAG area to conform with more recent project clarification. Figure 1 shows where lanes were added (green) or were taken away (orange) between versions 8.3 and 8.3.1 highway networks.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Lane Change between 2019 and 2050 for Model v8.3.2 2022-02-04.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speed of rail transit is coded onto rail-only links within the master highway network. Transit speed for LRT were updated to reflect 2019 operations. Most of the speed changes were less than 5 mph. Figure 2 shows where light rail speeds were changed.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Change in Transit Speeds for LRT in Salt Lake County. Green: Increase in Speeds — Red: Decrease in Speeds.\n\n\ntbl-lrt-speed shows the resulting average speeds along entire light rail routes.

Auto-generated walk-access links are created between zone centroids and transit stops within a certain distance as defined by area of the zone, as long as they do not cross barriers as defined by functional type. Hand-coded walk-access links are user-defined, supplemental walk access where an auto-generated link would not be created or where walk access is more attractive than the TAZ structure and auto-generated links would suggest.\nThe update process removed a majority of the general hand-coded walk access links, reducing the number from 234 to 31 links. Areas that retained or added hand-coded links include SLC International Airport, Hill Air Force Base, University of Utah, and Utah Valley University. Figure 3 shows hand-coded walk-access links before and after the updates.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Hand-Coded Walk Access Links.\n\n\n\n\n\nPark-and-Ride lots are coded onto nodes within the master highway network and are defined by what transit mode they service. To be used by the travel model, park-and-ride nodes need to be coded at nodes that serve as rail or bus stops. Figure 4 (a) shows what changes were made to park-and-ride lots, which include 17 additional locations, 49 removed locations, and 14 locations that were modified by changing the mode they service. Most of the park-and-ride lots removals were due to redundancy on highway nodes adjacent to another park-and-ride lot at a rail node. The park-and-ride lots additions mostly included new lots along express bus routes. The resulting park-and-ride lot locations, including ones that were not edited, are shown in Figure 4 (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Park-And-Ride Lot Changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Park-And-Ride Lots After Updates\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Park-And-Ride Lots.

Transit line files include route alignments, stop locations, and peak/off-peak headway designation. Additionally, 2024, 2030, 2040, 2050, 2030UF, 2040UF, 2050UF transit was updated to reflect 2019 input changes.\nA general edit that was made to all lines that connect directly to rail was the removal of bus stops on a roadway node directly adjacent to a stop at a rail node. Only the rail node stop remains. Due to the amount of lines affected by this change, they are not listed individually in the line details below. There were also a couple of highway network edits made in relation to transit line changes:\n\nAt the Blue Line end-of-line in Draper, the centroid connector for the rail station connection to the highway network moved offintersection of Pioneer Road / 1300 East intersection and connected directly to Pioneer Drive.\nA connection between 24th Street and Wall Avenue in Ogden was added to represent the existing connection on each side of theviaduct. The associated transit-only link was removed.\n\nThe line file changes are shown in the lists below, arranged by file and route name.

    "text": "Mode Choice\nMode choice was recalibrated to match target values from UTA 2019 On-Board Survey.\nThe following changes were made in the transit .FAC files in PT_Parameter Folder and associated voyager script in mode choice:\n\nDecreased WAITFACTOR to 2.0 (previously 3.0).\nChanged mode-specific weight applied to transit in-vehicle times and non-transit leg times (Relative mode factor to the skimmed specific mode) for express bus to 3.50.\nChanged the following to fine-tune boardings by mode (to increase for LCL, and decrease for other modes).\nAdded initial boarding penalty for local bus of 5 minutes.\nIncreased transit transfer boarding penalty to 12 minutes for all modes but walk to local which was set at 6 minutes (previously 10 minutes for all modes).\n\nAdditional changes were made to mode choice:\n\nCombined Mode Choice scripts 11 and 12 into ‘11_12_MC_HBW_HBO_NHB_HBC.s’ to allow simultaneous running on eight cores.\nBRT Mode 9 constants were calibrated independently of LRT. However, BRT Mode 5 continues to use a multiplier of the LRT constant and was increased to 0.40 from 0.33.\nAdjustments were made to FrontRunner to bring station boardings closer to observed. Davis County boardings were significantly higher than observed, while Utah County boardings were significantly lower. A +15 multiplier of initial in-vehicle time penalty was added to all stations in Davis County, while -15 multiplier of in-vehicle time was added to all stations in Utah County. This brought boardings closer to observed, but there is still significant difference in boardings that should be accounted for when using the model for any station-level forecasts. A comparison of station model and observed volumes is found in the final section of this document comparing v8.3.2 to v8.3.1."

The following edits were made to the ATO script:\n\nMade output field names more descriptive.\nChanged output format from dbf to csv.\nAdded Free Flow auto time and straight-line time (based on auto free flow) ATO calculations/output\nUpdated script to get the ATO weights from empirical HBW distance decay curve from Household Travel Survey as a look up table rather than calculate from a step function."
