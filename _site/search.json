    "text": "Auto Ownership\nThe Auto Ownership model begins with the disaggregated households by TAZ and calculates how many vehicles each group owns. Households by vehicle ownership is grouped by 0, 1, 2, and 3+ vehicles. Auto ownership is based on utility functions for each combination of household size group, worker group, and income level (low/high). The utilities for each TAZ are then converted into probabilities. When the probabilities are multiplied by the associated number of households, then an auto ownership distribution by TAZ is created.\nThe utility functions for auto ownership contain a series of binary and linear variables. The binary variables are loop toggles that are set to 1 or 0 for household size groups, worker groups, and income levels. There are also two linear variables that are taken from TAZ attributes: population density of five nearest zones and employment within 30 minutes by transit. The coefficients for the utility function are shown in Table 1.\nThe code loops through the three groups to create utilities for each combination of binary variables for each TAZ. As can be seen in the table, for household size groups 5 and 6+, 3+ workers in a household, and high income, there are zero utility coefficients, which mean for combinations with these variables there is no utility. Additionally, the 3-vehicle utility is always set to 0 for every combination.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Coefficients for Vehicle Ownership Utility Functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n0-Vehicle Utility Function Coefficients\n1-Vehicle Utility Function Coefficients\n2-Vehicle Utility Function Coefficients\n3+-Vehicle Utility Function Coefficients\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n-5.007\n-2.185\n0.148\n0\n\n\nHousehold Size of 1\n3.671\n3.441\n0.951\n0\n\n\nHousehold Size of 2\n1.036\n1.016\n0.758\n0\n\n\nHousehold Size of 3\n0.186\n0.134\n-0.318\n0\n\n\nHousehold Size of 4\n0.001\n-0.738\n-0.793\n0\n\n\nHousehold Size of 5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nHousehold Size of 6+\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0 Worker in Household\n0.998\n0.514\n0\n0\n\n\n1 Workers in Household\n0\n0.552\n0.081\n0\n\n\n2 Workers in Household\n0\n0\n0.07\n0\n\n\n3+ Workers in Household\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nLow Income (Group 1)\n2.733\n1.557\n0.538\n0\n\n\nHigh Income (Group 2-4)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nPopulation Density of 5 nearest Zones\n0.05159\n0.07346\n0.02366\n0\n\n\nEmployment within 30 minutes by transit\n1.99e-05\n8.342e-06\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the utility values, probabilities for the vehicle ownership groups are calculated for each TAZ for each combination. The probability is the ratio of the exponential utility of each vehicle ownership group divided by the sum of the exponential utility of all three vehicle ownership groups for each combination. The vehicle ownership probabilities are multiplied by their associated household numbers as calculated in the household disaggregation script to get the number of households in each vehicle ownership group. Additionally, several aggregations are made to calculate total number of vehicles in different groupings. When calculating the number of vehicles in a 3+-vehicle group, the value of 3.5 number of vehicles per 3+ households is used.\n???Which validation charts should I add???"

ATO metrics quantify how well the current and future transportation system work with land use.

Accordingly, updates to parking data were done in a way to facilitate the change to the new methodology in the future. These updates include a new polygon source file for downtown and university areas. However, since the envisioned methodology removes the use of parking cost fields for Lagoon and Salt Lake City International Airport, they were not included in this new shapefile.\n\nDowntown and University Areas\nParking costs were developed for downtown areas for Ogden, Salt Lake City, and Provo, as well as major university areas along the Wasatch Front. A new source polygon shapefile was developed to hold rates for Home-Based Work (HBW), Home-Based College (HBC), Home-Based Other (HBO), and Non-Home-Based (NHB) trip purposes. While rates are included for these four purposes, the v9.0.0 model only utilizes HBW for permanent parking and HBO for temporary parking. The future methodology will incorporate all four purposes.\n???WHERE IS NEW SHAPEFILE… SHOW MAP OF NEW SHAPEFILE???\n\n\nLagoon and Salt Lake City International Airport\nThe Airport & Lagoon parking costs were updated based on current parking rate information and the assumptions described in this section.\nThe cost of permanent parking for the Lagoon TAZ was set to $0 based on the assumption that workers at Lagoon do not pay for parking. The temporary parking was set to $6 as calculated by dividing the 2022 advertised parking rate of $18 per day by an assumed average occupancy of 3 people per vehicle. The cost of temporary parking in previous models was $5 in 2010 dollars. The resulting $1 increase in 2019 dollars (20%) over 9 years seems reasonable.\nThe cost of permanent parking at the Salt Lake City International Airport was set to $0 based on the assumption that workers at the airport do not pay for parking. The cost of temporary parking was set to $1.25 based on a weighted average of short-term premium and economy rates and drop offs and a assumed average vehicle occupancy rate.\nThe 2022 the cost for the short-term premium parking in the garage is $5.00 per hour. Short-term economy rate is $2.00 per hour. And for drop-offs there is no charge for parking. The assumed occupancy rate of 2 people per vehicle would result in per-person rates of $2.50, $1.00, and $0.00, respectively. The average of the three per-person rates is $1.75. Given the unknown distribution of travelers, but assuming more drop-offs than parking, a lower value than $1.75 should be expected. The 2019 cost was chosen to be $1.25.\nCompared to the previous temporary parking values of $1 in 2010 dollars, the chosen cost represents a 25 cent increase in 2019 dollars (25%) over 9 years. This growth seems reasonable, especially given the recent improvements to the airport. Additional justification for the chosen increase is the CPI adjustment, which for the 2010 value of $1.00 in results in a 2019 value of $1.18.\n\n\n\n\nDistricts\nSmall District definitions and names were updated to include a larger number of TAZs than previous models’ small districts. There are now 129 total small districts sequentially numbered from northwest to southeast in each medium district. The small district name field DSML_NAME includes a prefix of Medium District index followed by a colon and then the sequential small district count (e.g. 15:1). Small districts were modified in conjunction with origin-destination data from StreetLight. Districts are shown in Figure 3.\n\n\nCode\nmapDistricts = {\n\n  let container = DOM.element('div', { style: `width:${width}px;height:${width/1.6}px` });\n  yield container;\n  \n  let map = L.map(container).setView([40.7608, -111.8910], 8.25);\n\n  let greyLayer = L.tileLayer('https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png', {\n    attribution: '&copy; &lt;a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; contributors'\n  }).addTo(map);\n\n  let lcolors     = ['#FF0000'       ,'#00FF00'        ,'#0000FF'        ];\n  let llabels     = ['Small District','Medium District','Large District' ];\n\n  let lyrLDst = L.geoJson(geojsonLDst, { weight: 12.00, color: lcolors[2], fillOpacity: 0}).addTo(map);\n  let lyrMDst = L.geoJson(geojsonMDst, { weight:  6.00, color: lcolors[1], fillOpacity: 0}).addTo(map);\n  let lyrSDst = L.geoJson(geojsonSDst, { weight:  2.00, color: lcolors[0], fillOpacity: 0}).addTo(map);\n\n  lyrSDst.eachLayer(function(layer) {\n    var name = layer.feature.properties.DSML_NAME; // Assuming the attribute field is named \"DSML_NAME\"\nlayer.bindTooltip(name); // Add tooltip\n    // OR\n    // layer.bindPopup(name); // Add popup\n  });\n\n  var legend = L.control({position: 'bottomleft'});\n    legend.onAdd = function (map) {\n      var div = L.DomUtil.create('div', 'legend');\n      div.innerHTML = '';\n      for (var i = 0; i &lt; llabels.length; i++) {\n        div.innerHTML += '&lt;i style=\"background:' + lcolors[i] + '\"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt; ' + llabels[i] + '&lt;br/&gt;';\n      }\n\n      // Add CSS style for the background color\n      div.style.backgroundColor = 'lightgray';\n      div.style.padding = '10px';\n      \n      return div;\n    };\n    legend.addTo(map);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Districts\n\n\n\nTwo additional polygon shapefiles were added to the Districts subfolder:\n\nThe Wasatch Front subarea is included in WF_Subarea.shp\nThe REMM district areas is included in Dist_REMM_Area.shp\n\n???SHOW SHAPEFILES???\n\n\nSource\nThe _Source subfolder was added and includes the following shapefile data sets: Cities, Counties, Districts, and Environmental Constraints.

The fare files were updated with 2019 fare data. The fares were updated to match the actual advertised fares, whereas the v8.3.2 model contained a 46% adjustment fares. This reduction accounts for monthly pass, education, fare-pay, senior, employer paid, and other discounts. This adjustment will be added into the General Parameters file and incorporated into the scripts in a future version. ???ADD REFERENCE??? As such, an additional set of fare files with a Discounted suffix were created and are being used consistent v8.3.2 and methodology.\n\n\nGeneral Hand-Coded Support Links\nGeneral_hand_coded_walk_links.NTL files were updated to account for new highway node numbering and TAZs.\n\n\nTransit Route Tester\nA _chk Transit Compile on Net folder was added with a separate route tester script for each model scenario. The script checks to see if transit line files for the respective scenario compile on the scenario highway network. The scripts create scenario networks in the _temp - Scenario Net folder. A .VPR file has scenario transit lines pre-loaded onto the network. This can be used for easy transit line edits.\nThe scripts create error reports (e.g. check - 1 - BY_2023.txt) that contain any issues if the transit network fails to compile on the highway network.

Decreases in volume in v9.0.0 compared to v8.3.2 are shown in blue, while increases are shown in red. Salt Lake and northern Davis counties display a drop in roadway volumes, most apparent on I-15. Weber, southern Davis, and Utah Counties show increases. Most of the changes are relatively minor, with the largest decreases occurring on the freeways in Salt Lake County. However, given the large daily volume for these roadways, the percent change is relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) 2050\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Model Daily Volumes Comparison (v9.0 vs v8.3.2)\n\n\n???WOULD BE BETTER TO REMOVE LINKS THAT HAVE ZERO LANES, NOTE MUTLIPLE UTAH LAKE CROSSING LINKS IN BOTH 2019 and 2050.\n???MAY BE GOOD TO INCLUDE TRUCK VOLUME COMPARISON???\n\n\n\nTransit comparisons were done with ridership, trips mode share, and boardings mode share. Overall ridership increases significantly in v9.0.0, and Core Bus ridership takes a larger share of trips and boardings than in v8.3.2.\n\n\nTransit ridership in v9.0.0 compared to v8.3.2 shows significant increase in 2032, 2042, and 2050. See Figure 2. The total ridership in 2050 for v9.0.0 is 332,000 daily trips compared to the v8.3.2 model that showed 258,000 daily trips, which represents a 29% increase.

This large increase is consistent with the transit inputs into the model with a large number of Core Bus routes coming into production in 2032, replacing mostly local bus service.
