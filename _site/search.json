    "text": "Mode choice was considered a relatively weak link in version 2.1, particularly for non-work trips. It has been extensively revised. The mode choice models’ major deficiencies were lack of independent Logit models for the HBO and NHB purposes. Trips for these purposes were calculated by factoring HBW trips – a practice considered sub-standard by the January 2001 peer review. Independent models for each purpose now exist.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mode Choice Model Nesting Structure (and nesting coefficients).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Mode Choice Model Coefficients by purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nHBW, HBC, and HBO models have been market segmented by three auto-ownership classes (0,1,2), and two income classes (lowest income quartile, 3 highest income quartiles). Since NHB by definition has no specific household information, HNB trips cannot be segmented using household data.\n\n\n\nVersion 2.1 contained an “all or nothing” approach to determining whether a zone had walk access to transit. If the zone centroid was within ½ mile of a bus stop, 100% of the zone had access (3/4 mile for rail). However, network-traced paths often require far more walking than would occur in reality. Further, a wide variance in the size of zones (and hence the number of people who “have access”) caused some concern.\nThe new approach attempts to determine the percentage of each zone’s area that truly is within walk distance of transit. GIS is used to create a 4/10 mile buffer around bus lines, express bus stops, and rail stops. This buffer is then intersected with the TAZs to estimate the number of people and jobs within the buffer.\nThe algorithm to determine walk-access times for zones within walking distance of transit makes a concerted effort to trace at least one walk path to a transit stop for all zones within walking distance of transit. This is done by tracing a series of access paths, increasing the maximum path length over the network. The algorithm then caps the access path length at .4 miles.\n\n\n\nA coding flaw was also discovered that affected drive access to transit. The previous code ensured drive-to-transit access in the form of park-n-ride links, but neglected to ensure that there were walk links available to egress the system at the destination. In other words, you could easily drive-to-transit, it was just hard to find places where you could get off. Modes where drive access can range from 25-85% (express bus, light rail, commuter rail), were seeing only a 10-15% drive share in Version 2.1. This has been corrected.\n\n\n\nFTA New Starts funding requests require the analysis of mode choice output using software named “Summit”. FTA developed Summit for comparing two alternatives to determine “winners and losers”. It is a useful tool for all types of alternatives analysis, including highway alternatives. The model can now easily generate the input required for Summit with a simple toggle switch.\n\n\n\nVersion 2.1 had a carry over from much earlier models that assumed that if a bus traveled on any street outside the CBD or a freeway, that its average speed (including stops) would be 0.9 multiplied by the average congested speed for vehicles. This may be true under the most extreme congestion, but for most circumstances the relative speeds between buses and private autos is more pronounced.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Mode choice was considered a relatively weak link in version 2.1, particularly for non-work trips. It has been extensively revised. The mode choice models’ major deficiencies were lack of independent Logit models for the HBO and NHB purposes. Trips for these purposes were calculated by factoring HBW trips – a practice considered sub-standard by the January 2001 peer review. Independent models for each purpose now exist.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mode Choice Model Nesting Structure (and nesting coefficients).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Mode Choice Model Coefficients by purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nHBW, HBC, and HBO models have been market segmented by three auto-ownership classes (0,1,2), and two income classes (lowest income quartile, 3 highest income quartiles). Since NHB by definition has no specific household information, HNB trips cannot be segmented using household data.\n\n\n\nVersion 2.1 contained an “all or nothing” approach to determining whether a zone had walk access to transit. If the zone centroid was within ½ mile of a bus stop, 100% of the zone had access (3/4 mile for rail). However, network-traced paths often require far more walking than would occur in reality. Further, a wide variance in the size of zones (and hence the number of people who “have access”) caused some concern.\nThe new approach attempts to determine the percentage of each zone’s area that truly is within walk distance of transit. GIS is used to create a 4/10 mile buffer around bus lines, express bus stops, and rail stops. This buffer is then intersected with the TAZs to estimate the number of people and jobs within the buffer.\nThe algorithm to determine walk-access times for zones within walking distance of transit makes a concerted effort to trace at least one walk path to a transit stop for all zones within walking distance of transit. This is done by tracing a series of access paths, increasing the maximum path length over the network. The algorithm then caps the access path length at .4 miles.\n\n\n\nA coding flaw was also discovered that affected drive access to transit. The previous code ensured drive-to-transit access in the form of park-n-ride links, but neglected to ensure that there were walk links available to egress the system at the destination. In other words, you could easily drive-to-transit, it was just hard to find places where you could get off. Modes where drive access can range from 25-85% (express bus, light rail, commuter rail), were seeing only a 10-15% drive share in Version 2.1. This has been corrected.\n\n\n\nFTA New Starts funding requests require the analysis of mode choice output using software named “Summit”. FTA developed Summit for comparing two alternatives to determine “winners and losers”. It is a useful tool for all types of alternatives analysis, including highway alternatives. The model can now easily generate the input required for Summit with a simple toggle switch.\n\n\n\nVersion 2.1 had a carry over from much earlier models that assumed that if a bus traveled on any street outside the CBD or a freeway, that its average speed (including stops) would be 0.9 multiplied by the average congested speed for vehicles. This may be true under the most extreme congestion, but for most circumstances the relative speeds between buses and private autos is more pronounced. Version 3.0 conducted a substantial review of UTA’s scheduled stops (to determine typical average bus speeds), and compared these against average private auto congested speeds obtained using GPS. The resulting factors are noted below. The new transit speed coding methodology, as well as the observed auto speed data allowed us to closely model observed bus speeds (see Figure 3) and bus boardings (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Congested Speed Factors between Model Versions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2.1\n#.#* Congested speed\nVersion 3.0\n#.#* Congested speed\n\n\n\n\nFreeway factor\n1.0\nFreeway factor\n0.9\n\n\nFreeway factor\n\nRamp factor\n0.5\n\n\nCBD factor\n0.5\nPrincipal/Collector\n0.6\n\n\nAll others\n0.9\nMinor art CBD/urban\n0.55\n\n\nAll others\n\nMinor art Suburban/rural\n0.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: 2001 Modeled vs. Actual Bus Speed Comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: 2001 Mode vs. Actual Bus Boardings."

    "text": "Researching the details for Commuter Rail forecasting revealed the 3.1 model had an inordinately high share of Home-Based College trips on transit. There were several contributing problems. First, the Nov. 2002 on-board survey incorrectly categorized many trips. 15% of HBC trips were made by people over 30 years old. We believe most of these were likely work trips attracted to a college; they were thus reclassified. Another 10% were attracted to small colleges that we do not account for (cosmetology colleges, etc.). These were reclassified as HBO. New target values were computed from the changes.\nIn addition, the total number of HBC trips was low. Since the total light-rail trips to the U of U was known and calibrated to (by means of the light-rail alternative specific constant), but the total trips to the U of U was low, the result was an overly high share of HBC transit trips relative to auto trips. Daily HBC productions per student was raised from 0.7 to 1.0 to help correct this.\nCollege distribution is based on the zipcode of the student’s reported address. However, many students report their parent’s address for mailings. Where the address is reasonably close to the college, the student probably lives at home; but where the address exceeds 30, 40, and even 50 miles; it becomes less likely that they actually live there, or that they make frequent trips to the college. In the case of the U of U, 1.5% of the HBC trips supposedly came from Weber County, which ranges from 35-50 miles away. To counter this, HBC productions were distributed on a distance gradient with 1.5 HBC productions/day for student addresses within 1 mile of campus, changing linearly to 0.1 HBC productions/day for student addresses exceeding 40 miles. Future year distributions also have an adjustment for high-growth zones that are within range of the college.\n\n\n\nThe Non-home-based purpose was also unusually high in the 2002 on-board survey. Again, suspect surveys may be to blame. NHB trips exceeding 10 miles were excluded from the survey. NHB trips that involved driving were excluded unless the CBD was a trip-end.\n\n\n\nVersion 3.1 included a grid of walk access support links that were manually input for the SL CBD. This grid made it possible for many “transit trips” to walk along the grid without actually taking transit. The result was an under-estimate of the number of CBD circulation trips taken by transit. The manual links were removed, and improved logic was added to the auto-generation of these support links.\nThe on-board survey was also assigned to the transit network at FTA’s recommendation to reveal surveyed trips that could not be assigned to the correct path type. The result lead to increasing the park-n-ride travel sheds, adding new PNR lots, and adjusting the path favoring weights.\n\n\n\nWe have wrestled for a means of defining a Bus Rapid-Transit line for modeling purposes. BRT is a broad category that could range from little more than a bus with limited stops all the way up to a light-rail-like alignment with full stations. There is no observed “BRT mode” from which to select an alternative specific constant, so we developed a checklist to help reveal the most appropriate modeling definition. Basically, if the proposal appears to be very light-rail-like, we are recommending it be coded as a slower-than-normal LRT (mode 7). If it shares more traits with a bus, a faster-than-normal bus (mode 4) seems appropriate. If it is a hybrid, model it both ways and assume ridership in the middle. A “how-to” memo defines the presently supported method.\n\n\n\nBefore BRT was proposed in South Davis, we assumed a simple increase in the frequency of existing South Davis buses to obtain a future network. After BRT was adopted in the LRP, we neglected to review the whole system for redundancy. We now have only the BRT, and Commuter Rail (CRT) serving SL CBD from South Davis, with supporting feeder routes. Before we had all of these and a host of high-frequency local buses, which was inordinately high service relative to the rest of the region. BRT is defined at 15,15 headways and CRT is 20,60. This should provide a good base from which to compare and develop alternatives for the South Davis transit study."

The Mode-Choice variable coefficients will be re-estimated using local surveys (as opposed to the “synthetic” model parameters that are presently borrowed from other areas). Something will be done to better distribute zero-car households. At a minimum this would be expressly distributing this market with a gravity model, but we’re hoping to find a way to abandon the HBW gravity model altogether in favor of a destination-choice model.

Most were corrected in the 3.2 model, but a few additional steps are taken in the 4.0 model.\nZero-car distribution: Specific distribution of zero-car households along more probable paths (typically paths easily served by transit).\nNew Park-n-Ride method: Though not requested or identified by FTA as a deficiency, we overhauled the algorithm for drive access to transit. Previously, the model inadvertently allowed people to drive quite long distances to take short transit trips (i.e. Many would skip a close PNR lot in favor of a far lot because they could minimize their travel time. However, this defeats the purpose of taking transit). The new method is directly linked to PNR lots noted on the highway network, and better ensures that the trip will select the most logical access point. Further, a drive/transit in-vehicle ratio in the MC model is used to hinder the probability of selecting a path with a high ratio. The affect is more on where you board the system rather than whether you board the system."

In the new method, longer distance trips will be based 100% on time savings, and shorter trips will have some fraction of both time and distance. We believe this better reflects the true nature of trips; namely that shorter trips are more inclined to just go straight between their origin and destination, while on longer trips one is far more in tune with choosing only the path that saves the most time. The shares and settings will be determined as part of calibration.\nDestination Choice Logit model: This has been delayed, but may make it back in during the months following July."

It will likely undergo testing and possibly be implemented by early next summer.\n\n\nUrbanSim\nAndy Li is making great progress is being made on testing and implementing UrbanSim. We hope to use it to assist in the development and analysis of the next long-range plan (due in 2006).\n\n\nHome Interview Survey\nThere is continued debate about what exactly is needed in this arena. The committee involved in this is wrestling with how to scope for this, and design a survey or several surveys that will get us the most valuable information available for the money.\n\n\nReplace TRNBUILD with PUBLIC TRANSPORT\nThe transit travel times and assignment utilize the Citilab’s TrnBuild module, which is a carry over from the Minutp platform. Citilabs ceased development on TrnBuild after acquiring the Public Transport (PT) module from a European firm that specialized in transit route choice and graphical display of results. As we learn more about PT, we will replace TrnBuild. We are unsure as to how much this will improve our accuracy of modeling transit, but it will certainly allow us access to better graphics and analytical methods, which alone should highlight opportunities for improvement.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Regional calibration summary between version 3.2 and version 4.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Calibration average speeds weighted by number of segments."

The regular gravity model will not model this well, considering it simply another retailer and sending trips to it primarily from within northern Utah County and southern SL County. In 4.2, its trip generation magnitude and distribution is created in an off-model spreadsheet, and the resulting trip table is fed into the model. This ensures that trips will be drawn from across the region, including Weber County and all major external stations.

    "text": "Drive to transit access location improved (a 4.0 feature)\nIn 3.2, all PNR lots to be used in all years were coded as “higher draw” (15 minute) or “lower draw” (12 minute) ASCII files. Any zone within the max travel time was given access. We discovered this construction had numerous flaws. First, many trips in the survey drove more than 15 minutes to reach light rail (particularly from Utah Co). Next, a given zone may be within 12 minutes of as many as 8 light rail PNR lots, and the skim builder was set so as to encourage them to drive to the furthest most lot in order to minimize the time on transit. This was because when building rail-favored paths, we inadvertently avoided penalizing the drive portion of the path. Since the objective is to select a path that minimizes the weighted times, and since driving 5 miles is typically faster than riding 5-miles in the train, the path builder effectively told drivers to stay on the road as long as you can, defeating the reasons people drive to transit. This was not so much a problem with the number of trips that would access the mode as it was with selecting illogical locations to access the mode. The 4.0 model now weights the drive portion of mode-favoring, encouraging drivers to select the nearest lot.\nThus we found a 12-15 minute travel shed is too much and too little at the same time (some zones access far more PNR lots than they logically would select, and zones that would drive many miles to reach end-of-line stations don’t have the option). This manually supplied ASCII file method also requires accounting for future light-rail PNR lots even in the base year. These lots are not used by the MC model for LRT trips. They can be used for a bus trip, which is fine, but it makes the book-keeping difficult.\nVersion 4.0 abandons the manual method in favor of a network-based algorithm with the following steps:\n\nID lots on network: Modeler identifies all potential PNR lots as node attributes on the master network by a modal hierarchy: A code 80 means that in runs where commuter rail stops at that node, drive access to commuter rail should be available. Drive access is then also available to all lesser modes if they happen to stop at that node. See the table below for codes.\nConfirm that lot coincides with eligible routes for scenario: Initial paths for the scenario network are built, and all transit stops are identified by node and mode. The result is a list of nodes where yes, the node was identified as an existing/potential PNR lot for that mode; and yes, that mode actually stops at that node.\nWrite PNR access code for most logical access point: The nearest confirmed lots to a given zone are identified, and a TP+/Voyager format PNR record is recorded for that path. For commuter rail, only the nearest 2 lots are recorded. For light rail, BRT, and express bus, it’s the nearest 3.\n\nThe results are much improved over the 3.2 method. Note that for light rail in SL County, even the western most zones can access the Sandy Trax line (not observable in 3.2), and only at lots along the same latitude. (See Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Improved light rail transit access."

Citilabs ceased development on TrnBuild after acquiring the Public Transport (PT) module from a European firm that specialized in transit route choice and graphical display of results.

The Logit structure historically has stopped after identifying drive alone, shared ride 2 person, and 3+ persons. Now it dips further to assess who in each of these categories would be willing to pay a toll if available, and who would be motivated to use HOV lanes – and even form new car pools as a result of HOV lanes. Once mode choice has identified these persons, these “managed lane trip tables” are assigned to specifically identified managed lane links on the highway network. Thus when comparing build/no-build, the MC model can determine the new shared-ride or toll linked trips created by the managed lanes (i.e. how many vehicle trips were eliminated by the lanes, or revenue generated by the lanes). Network assignment then shows the levels of demand and capture rate of HOV eligible vehicles at points along the system.\nThere are several nuances that complicate the implementation of these features to be aware of (detailed elsewhere). 1) The existing HOV lane is relatively new and it will be difficult to assess its true usage until congestion again becomes significant. Hence calibrating to today’s usage levels may be less important than assessing the lanes usage and capture rates under significant congestion and relative to experience in other cities. 2) This implementation tends toward what one might expect of barrier separated lanes more than the “easy on-easy off” painted lanes that we have now. In other words, with painted separation, someone who uses the lane may not actually enter the lane until the point they first encounter slow downs – and they may exit once speeds are back to normal. Here, trips tagged to use the lane at any point will enter the lane at their first opportunity, and exit at the last possible moment. Thus the number of users is similar, but the length of use may be quite different. “If you’re going to use it at all, then use it for as long as possible” is how this implementation works.

We tested adding one minute to terminal times and expected to see trip lengths reduce somewhat (the feedback loop logically would encourage shorter distance trips if the time to take those trips is greater). However, trips actually went further. The investigation revealed that friction factor curves needed updating and slightly different implementation.\nTo make a long story short, 4.3 beta has newly calibrated friction factor curves, as well as different curves for different conditions (curves specific to free flow speeds as well as congested speeds). Non-work purposes were also “doubly constrained”. At the advice of peers and observation of results, these are now more singly constrained. The combination of distribution improvements also resulted in a model that calibrates without the aid of link penalties that have traditionally been applied at geographic choke points."

The model system was enhanced to allow explicit representation of HOV and toll trips. This was done by extending the nested logit mode choice model to consider toll and HOV highway travel separately from general purpose lane highway travel, in the same way that the model differentiates between local, express, and rail transit modes.\nThis structure allows the mode choice model to explicitly trade-off the time and costs associated with each of the highway paths (HOV versus toll versus general purpose lane travel). The model is segmented by household income, reflecting different cost sensitivities by income group, time period (peak versus off-peak), and by trip purpose, reflecting that travelers tend to have a higher value of time when making work trips than trips for other purposes. The model captures trade-offs between highway and transit modes, while recognizing higher bus operating speeds due to the availability of HOV lanes. Trips for each mode are assigned to a network representation and analyzed to determine facility operating characteristics (volume, volume/capacity ratio, congested speed).\nThe model is flexible enough to test a fairly broad range of policies, including HOV lanes, HOT lanes (where HOVs pay no toll or a smaller toll), and toll-way lanes (where every user pays). The model can analyze a distance-based toll policy, and the toll rate can vary by time period. Daily toll revenue can be estimated by analyzing toll demand and average toll paid on each facility by time period. Different toll rates can be applied to HOT lanes or toll-way lanes, but all HOT lanes must have the same toll rate, and all toll-way lanes must have the same toll rate.\nThe managed lane model enhancements have not been calibrated to existing data in the WFRC/MAG region, due to no toll facilities existing in the region and limited data from the existing HOV lanes. Some HOV data were available from a study done by the Traffic Lab at the University of Utah and these data were used more to get the base year HOV forecast into a reasonable range. That said, prior to using the model to forecast HOV demand, it is recommended that the base year HOV forecast be reassessed for reasonableness using available data.\nMore detailed documentation on the nature of the changes and how to make use of the managed lanes’ analytical methods are available from WFRC or MAG."

    "text": "Trip distribution improvements\nSeveral improvements have been made to the trip distribution models, including new HBW destination choice models and refinements to the gravity models for non-work purposes.\nThe introduction of a destination choice model complicates the model chain and significantly enhances model run-time. The destination choice models utilize mode choice model logsums, among other variables, to estimate work-trip distributions. Therefore to utilize the destination choice model, the mode choice model needs to be run first, whereas in order to run mode choice, we first need a congested network, which requires running distribution and assignment. The sequence of models is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: New model chain.\n\n\nThe first trip distribution step is very similar to how trip distribution used to operate, utilizing the gravity model and iteratively running towards convergence with highway assignment. Gravity models are run for each trip purpose, including work. For non-work trip purposes the output of the distribution-assignment feedback loop is the final trip table. For home-based work, the destination choice model produces the final HBW trip table.\nThe gravity model has newly calibrated friction factor curves, as well as different curves for different conditions (curves specific to free flow speeds as well as congested speeds). Additionally, non-work purposes used to be “doubly constrained,” but at the advice of peers non-work purposes are no longer doubly-constrained.\nAs part of this effort, PB Consult has developed destination choice models for the Home Based Work (HBW) trip purpose. The destination choice model form has many advantages over the traditional gravity model. First, the destination choice models are disaggregate and based on behavioral choice theory, making them more theoretically sound than gravity models. Further, they are more flexible, capturing multiple variables into a utility equation. The models use the logsums calculated in mode choice as the measure of travel impedance. This makes the destination choice model consistent with and sensitive to all transportation modes in the mode choice model. If transit system improvement results in more trips between locations, for example, then these new trips will use the new transit improvement. This feature is fundamental in the evaluation of any proposed transit system extension.\nThe major impetus for the changes to trip distribution at this time came from the Mountain View Corridor study, where dedicated toll-ways are being considered. The previous trip distribution model was not sensitive to toll level-of-service, only general purpose auto travel time. The implications of this limitation would have been a modeling system that did not recognize toll-ways as influencing trip distribution, and moreover trip distribution would only have been a function of much slower general purpose travel times. The destination choice model effectively considers the ease of travel by all modes in estimating the work trip distribution. To appropriately sensitize the gravity models to more than simply general purpose auto travel time, composite impedances is now used in the gravity models that are a weighted average of general purpose and toll travel times.\nNotably, this combination of distribution improvements has resulted in a model that calibrates without the aid of link penalties that have traditionally been applied at geographic choke points. It does not matter whether there are penalties on the network; these penalties are controlled via a script (UpdateLinkPenalties.block).\nMore comprehensive documentation on the destination choice model is available from WFRC or MAG."

    "text": "Mode choice improvements\nThe modifications to trip distribution necessitated recalibrating the mode choice model constants to match observed trips by mode. In addition, the new managed lane forecasting process resulted in a new mode choice model nesting structure, as shown in Figure 2. In this structure, auto trips are first split in drive alone vs. shared ride trips, and then further classified as general purpose trips (i.e. no managed lanes), HOV trips (i.e. use an HOV lane) or toll trips (i.e. use either a HOT lane or a toll-way facility). This classification requires skimming different travel times and costs for these new managed lane modes. Trips estimated by the mode choice model to use managed lanes are then assigned to managed lanes during vehicle assignment.\nThrough extensive review and use of the model it became clear that the on-board survey done by UTA in Fall, 2002 had too many college trips on the light rail system. Utilizing a combination of data sources, including station-level boardings and a Fall, 2002 survey of University of Utah students, the number of college rail trips targeted by the model was significantly reduced. The primary reason for the survey data being too high was thought to be a misunderstanding among survey respondents, where “college” was selected as a trip purpose, even though the person may have been going to work at the college or going to the college for some other reason.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: New mode choice model nesting structure."

    "section": "Vehicle Assignment Improvements",
    "text": "Vehicle Assignment Improvements\nThere were two important modifications to the vehicle assignment routine. First, to accommodate managed lanes and utilize different cost functions for long versus short trips, a multi-class, multi-user assignment (MMA) algorithm is now used. This assignment algorithm is very flexible, allowing different assignment rules for different types of trips and/or facilities. For example, managed lane trips are the only trips allowed on managed lanes. In addition, long and short vehicle trips are assigned to shortest paths using different cost functions. Short trips, currently specified as trips under 10 miles, are assigned based on a function of time and distance, with the thinking being that the both time and distance are important when time savings are minimal. For trips over 10 miles, the shortest time path is used, so distance is not a factor.\nThe second significant change was to the way assignment is run; fixing the number of iterations the assignment routine runs rather than utilizing convergence criteria. To implement this the convergence criteria were set at an unachievable level and a variable was used that defines the maximum iterations. The maximum iterations vary by time period (20 in the AM, 10 in the Midday, 30 in the PM and 10 in the evening). These can be modified if appropriate to reduce run-time assuming calibration results are not adversely affected. The rationale for fixing the number of iterations is one of assignment stability. It has been clearly demonstrated that assignment results oscillate or flip-flop from one iteration to the next between alternating shortest paths. As convergence is more closely achieved, the oscillation is less apparent. This approach attempts to minimize differences between loaded networks due to oscillations by fixing the number of iterations, preventing different assignments from stopping at different iterations. This helps make networks changes outside a corridor of interest (away from where the change occurred) more logical and less significant. The current default max iterations are large enough that previous convergence criteria will be satisfied, but run-time will increase."

The version 5 destination choice model was calibrated only so that the doubly-constrained base year result matched the observed trip length frequency. While this may sound like the result that one wants to achieve, it was clear that the process of doubly-constraining P’s and A’s was increasing trip lengths in the base year significantly.

This change broke the paths in the ‘HailMary.bat’ file to the Voyager executable. Rather than maintain two hailmary batch files (one for 32 bit operating systems and one for 64 bit systems), the model run launch point will now be done using a Cube script (HailMary.s).\nThe ‘HailMary.s’ launch point offers a few advantages:\n\nRunning the ‘ailMary.s’ script should work regardless of where Cube software is installed.\nError handling for the entire model stream is handled in Voyager. Previously, the ‘HailMary.bat’ included error handling between model scripts while Voyager handled errors inside the scripts. A text file indicating the step of the model is still generated as the model runs. These files are now found in the root directory which helps the user see the progress of the model in one location. If the model were to crash, this file also informs the user the script where the crash occurred. The model run print file (*.PRN) is also found in the root directory and contains information from the entire model run. This has the advantage of not having to hunt for this file in the scripts folder to identify model fatal errors and other information. However, this file can be large, which is a drawback. The aggregate runtime reported in the Voyager run window also represents the entire model runtime and not simply the runtime for an individual script.\nViewing and modifying the ‘HailMary.s’ script is easier and uses the same logic/rules the user is familiar with in running Voyager scripts. The user does not need to be familiar with DOS to manipulate scripts in the model run.\nThe model now calls the ‘0GeneralParameters.block’ and ‘1ControlCenter.block’ files only once at the beginning of the model run. If a user still would like to run individual scripts, the user will simply need to uncomment the READ statements at the beginning of the individual script to read in the general and scenario specific parameters. When finished, the user will then re-comment out these READ statements."

Previously, the ‘HailMary.bat’ included error handling between model scripts while Voyager handled errors inside the scripts. A text file indicating the step of the model is still generated as the model runs. These files are now found in the root directory which helps the user see the progress of the model in one location. If the model were to crash, this file also informs the user the script where the crash occurred. The model run print file (*.PRN) is also found in the root directory and contains information from the entire model run. This has the advantage of not having to hunt for this file in the scripts folder to identify model fatal errors and other information. However, this file can be large, which is a drawback. The aggregate runtime reported in the Voyager run window also represents the entire model runtime and not simply the runtime for an individual script.\nViewing and modifying the ‘HailMary.s’ script is easier and uses the same logic/rules the user is familiar with in running Voyager scripts. The user does not need to be familiar with DOS to manipulate scripts in the model run.\nThe model now calls the ‘0GeneralParameters.block’ and ‘1ControlCenter.block’ files only once at the beginning of the model run. If a user still would like to run individual scripts, the user will simply need to uncomment the READ statements at the beginning of the individual script to read in the general and scenario specific parameters. When finished, the user will then re-comment out these READ statements."

The decision was made to revise the model so that mode 5 would represent a lower class of BRT, similar to BRT I, which is generally characterized by improved passenger stations, off-board fare payment, and transit signal priority. Mode 9 was modified to represent a higher class of BRT, similar to BRT III, which includes all of the features of the lower class of BRT, but also includes substantial route segments with exclusive bus lanes.\n\n\nThe biggest difference from prior model versions is how the speed of BRT routes is coded. Previously, the model assumed that BRT would operate at 80% of the vehicle speed. Now it is up to the user to specify the desired operating speed. If the user neglects to specify the speed of the BRT route it will operate at the same speed as the local bus (approximately 60% of the vehicle speed, depending on the facility type of the road).\nThe user specifies the speed of the BRT route in the transit line file and should typically be via using the ‘TF’ function (see figure). The ‘TF’ function is a time factor that adjusts the transit travel time to the nodes following the ‘TF.’ A time factor less than 1.0 will increase the transit speed, while a factor greater than 1.0 will decrease the speed. As a general rule, it is recommended that the following time factors be used for modes 5 and 9.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: TF function for adjusting BRT speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Time Factors for Mode 5 and Mode 9\n\n\nMode\nTime Factor\n\n\n\n\nBRT Light (Mode 5)\n0.85\n\n\nBRT Heavy (Mode 9)\n0.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese factors will result in BRT-Light speeds that are approximately 70% of the vehicle speed and BRT-Heavy speeds that are approximately 80% of the vehicle speed.\nThis approach to BRT speeds allows maximum flexibility in setting the speeds, which can vary by segment. For example, if a route is coded as BRT Heavy because it is expected to be predominantly exclusive bus lanes, but with short segment of shared lanes with no other improvements, it is possible to vary the speeds by segment by coding the exclusive lane segments with a ‘TF’ of 0.75 and the shared lane segment with a 1.0.\nThe user may also use the ‘SPEED’ control in the line file to set the speed for the exclusive lane segments. ‘SPEED’ sets the link speed to a fixed value allowing the BRT line to run independent of adjacent roadway congestion. When the exclusive lane segment ends, a ‘TF’ control can be used to reset the BRT speed to once again be subject to roadway congestion.\n\n\n\nThe mode specific constant refers to the general attractiveness of each mode. Rail modes have the highest values while local bus has the lowest. Previously modes 5 and 9 had a constant that was halfway between local bus and light rail. These constants were modified so that mode 5 now has a constant of 33% of the difference between local bus and light rail and mode 9 has a constant of 67% of the difference."

The scripts were update to comply with this new requirement so the travel model will run on Cube 6.4.5 without crashing. That said, it is possible that future versions of Cube will address this issue.\nIn addition, Cube 6.4.5 was improved to allow for faster assignment processing in. According to Cube’s 6.4.5 release notes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n“New option F2 for PATHLOAD DEC keyword. Improves run time performance in path building.\nNew keyword MUTITHREAD to distribute Adjust phase across multiple processing cores. Includes sub keyword MEMORY, which is a Boolean option to set the temp files in memory or disk, when using MULTITHREAD. Only applies to COMBINE=EQUI.”\n\n\n\nThe command ‘DEC=F2’ was put into the PATHLOAD control statement and ‘MULTITHREAD=@CoresAvailable@, MEMORY=T’ in the assignment ‘block’ files to improve model runtime. These changes, however, resulted in only minor runtime improvements. These improvements were left in the model scripts but were commented out so users of Cube prior to the 6.4.5 release can still use the model. For those wishing to use this enhancement and have Cube 6.4.5, they will need to uncomment these items.\nThe following files were updated as part of the Cube 6.4.5 work:\n\nDistribution\n\n1_Distribution.s\n4pd_mainbody_distribution.block\n3_SumToDistricts_GRAVITY.s\n\nMode Choice\n\n03_Skim_auto.s\n06_HBW_logsums.s\n07_HBW_dest_choice.s\n11_Mc_HBW_HBO.s,12_Mc_NHB_HBC.s\n14_AsnTran.s\n18_SumToDistricts_FinalTripTables.s\n\nFinal Assignment\n\n4pd_mainbody_managedlanes.block\n4pd_mainbody_managedlanes_SelectLink.block"

    "text": "Segment Summary\nSeveral changes were made to the model’s inputs and code to allow for segment level processing of the model results.\nIn the ‘1_Inputs\\6_Segment’ folder, an updated master segment shapefile has been provided. This shapefile contains the segment geography used to summarize and report model data. The shapefile also contains historic UDOT observed volumes (AADT), medium and heavy truck factors, day-of-week and average weekday and weekend factors, and monthly and seasonal factors. Each segment in the segment shapefile has a unique SEGID which has been stamped onto appropriate links on the master highway network. Given the complex geometry in certain areas in the highway network, such as those found near freeway system-to-system interchanges, a polygon shapefile located in the ‘Stamping_Polygons’ folder was created to aid in the SEGID transfer from the segment shapefile onto the highway network links. Note in many cases not all model links in a segment currently receive a SEGID; rather, a sufficient number of links have been identified to represent the segment for data averaging.\nThe ‘1_Inputs\\6_Segment’ folder also contains a polygon shapefile located in the ‘SeasFac_Geog’ folder that contains geographic information that can be spatially joined onto the model highway links so that seasonal factors can be calculated for every link. This data is used by the air quality TDM2MOVES script located in the ‘2_ModelScripts\\7_PostProcessing\\1_TDM_2_MOVES\\1_TDM_2_MOVES - v1’ folder.\nA segment post processing script, ‘06_SegmentSummary.s’ located in the ‘2_ModelScripts\\5_AssignHwy’ folder, has been added to the model’s ’_HailMary.s’ batch script. This script summarizes the final assigned highway network data for the segments in the segment shapefile based on the SEGID on the highway network links. The script produces two summary reports, ‘v83_SE15_Net15_Summary_SEGID.dbf’ and ‘v83_SE15_Net15_Summary_SEGID_Detailed.dbf’ found in the output scenario’s ‘5_AssignHwy\\4_Summaries’ folder. The two files are identical except that the ‘Detailed’ report includes data summaries for all functional groups separately in addition to the total for all functional groups. The reports are generated automatically with every model run. The reports provide data summaries for each direction (direction 1=positive or eastbound/northbound direction, direction 2=negative or westbound/southbound direction) and for the total of both directions and include the following information:\n\nIdentifying fields:\n\nSEGID, functional group, SUBAREAID, county FIPS, and area type\n\nFields for each direction & total:\n\nNumber of Links\nOneway Distance\nNumber of Lanes\nFunctional Type Number and corresponding functional group\nAverage 1-hour, 1-lane capacity\nAverage volume by period (AM, MD, PM, EV & DY) and average daily truck volume (LT, MD, HV)\nAverage speed by period (free flow, AM, MD, PM, EV, DY)"

ATO metrics quantify how well the current and future transportation system work with land use. Both shorter travel times and an increased presence of employment and other opportunities result in higher accessibility scores.\nA script to calculate ATO metrics, ‘1_Access_to_Opportunity.s’ located in the ‘2_ModelScripts\\7_PostProcessing’ folder, has been added to the model’s ’_HailMary.s’ batch script and runs automatically with every model run. The script sums the number of jobs and households that are within a typical commute travel shed (in minutes) by auto and transit. The typical commute travel shed is defined using a distance decay curve estimated from the 2012 household travel survey. Metrics that combine the jobs and households are also calculated.\nResults from the ATO script are output into ‘7_PostProcessing\\Access_to_Opportunity_@DemographicYear@.dbf’.

This fix only affects labeling of socioeconomic data on the highway network in Cube and does not affect any travel model results.\nTIME fields on the network were edited to have four decimal places of precision instead of two (added to improve speed calculations). Subfolder structure was removed for ‘0_DeleteTempFiles.s’ script in ‘2_ModelScripts\\7_PostProcessing’ folder and corresponding edits were made in the ’_HailMary.s’ batch script.\n’_HailMary.s’ was updated to include more detail in the email functions.

    "text": "Model Results - Comparison with v8.3.1\nFigure 1 shows a comparison of daily roadway volume in the v8.3.2 model compared to the v8.3.1 model. Roadway links in red demonstrate an increase in traffic and green show a decrease in traffic between the new and the old model. The thicker the line and darker the color, the greater the magnitude of change. At the region level, the changes show that v.8.3.2 includes greater county-to-county flows as demonstrated in the 2019 base year with volume between Salt Lake County and both Davis and Utah Counties increasing while roadways such as I-80, I-215, and SR-201 showing decreasing traffic. This pattern is continued in the 2050 model with the intensity of change increasing on north/south freeways and arterials.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Model Daily Volumes Comparison (v8.3.2 vs v8.3.1).\n\n\nComparison of the highway volume validations of the v8.3.2 and v8.3.1 models are shown in Figure 2. There are separate charts by facility type and by county, as well as vehicle type. Medium and heavy truck trip generations and trip-length-frequencies were adjusted in the calibration process to bring model truck volumes closer in line with observed. Overall, for all vehicles the v8.3.2 model is closer to observed with all facility types within 4% of observed. Utah County improves significantly to only 1% low while Box Elder, Weber, and Davis counties are a couple percent lower than v8.3.1. When looked at by facility type, medium and heavy trucks see major improvements with minor arterials and major collectors and are much closer to observed by significant margins, but overall are slightly lower than observed as compared to v8.3.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Highway Volumes Validation (v8.3.2 and v8.3.1).\n\n\nFigure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5 show a comparison between daily model volumes by vehicle type with observed traffic volumes. There are slight changes in the All Vehicles figures between v8.3.2 and v8.3.1. Greater improvements are seen in the Medium and Heavy Truck figures, especially in the Box Elder and the Mountain View Corridor areas.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: All Vehicles Daily Volumes Comparison (Model vs Observed).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Medium Trucks Daily Volumes Comparison (Model vs Observed).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Heavy Trucks Daily Volumes Comparison (Model vs Observed)\n\n\nTransit ridership between v8.3.1 and v8.3.1 were compared at the trips, boardings, and mode share levels. Figure 6 and Figure 7 show a comparison of daily transit ridership and boardings for both the v8.3.2 and the v8.3.1 models. The v8.3.1 and v8.3.2 model transit was calibrated to the UTA On-Board Survey for 2015 and 2019, respectively, so the ridership for each of those models falls right on the OBS target. The boardings for the model are estimated but are close to average annual boardings as reported by UTA. Boardings between 2015 and 2019 have been relatively flat. The increase to 2050 is based on increased transit attractiveness and more supportive land use as built into the model.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Daily Transit Ridership - All Modes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Daily Boardings - All Modes.\n\n\nShare by transit mode is shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 for v8.3.2 and v8.3.1, respectively. In v8.3.2, Core Bus routes (Mode 5) show a greater portion of trips in v8.3.2 than in v8.3.1. These additional trips come mostly from Light Rail, which actually sees a decrease in mode share in 2030. Commuter Rail shares remain relatively consistent, as well as BRT.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Share by Transit Mode – v8.3.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Share by Transit Mode – v8.3.1.\n\n\nEven though the transit ridership forecasts are lower by 23% in v8.3.2 compared to v8.3.1, the 2019 to 2050 ratios for each model are similar with 2.0 in v8.3.2 and 2.2 in v8.3.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Comparison of 2019 and 2050 ratios.\n\n\nAs mentioned in a previous section, county-level adjustments were made in Davis and Utah counties to help better align station boardings in the model with observed. The comparison of the models with observed is shown in Figure 11. Due to these adjustments, there is a slight increase in Utah County boardings. However, Provo Station decreased slightly to just over half of what is observed. Davis County boardings proved to be more sensitive to the adjustment and a significant decrease is shown but still higher than observed boardings.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: 2019 Daily FrontRunner Boardings by Station Compared to Observed."

    "text": "Speed factor changes were made to the following locations:\n\nUS-89 North Davis County SFAC_BASE adjusted to 0.82\nLegacy Pkwy South of Parrish SFAC_BASE and SFAC_FUT set to 0.95\nUniversity Avenue from 300 South to 700 N SFAC_BASE and SFAC_FUT set to 0.85\nFreedom Boulevard from 300 South to 500 N SFAC_BASE and SFAC_FUT set to 0.85\nProvo Center Street from 500 West to University Ave SFAC_BASE and SFAC_FUT set to 0.60\n\nCapacity factors changes were made to the following locations:\n\nProvo Center Street from 500 West to University Ave CFAC_BASE and CFAC_FUT set to 0.85\n\n\n\nThe highway network was updated in the MAG and WFRC areas to reflect the third round of Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) amendments. Additional edits were made in the MAG area to conform with more recent project clarification. Figure 1 shows where lanes were added (green) or were taken away (orange) between versions 8.3 and 8.3.1 highway networks.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Lane Change between 2019 and 2050 for Model v8.3.2 2022-02-04.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speed of rail transit is coded onto rail-only links within the master highway network. Transit speed for LRT were updated to reflect 2019 operations. Most of the speed changes were less than 5 mph. Figure 2 shows where light rail speeds were changed.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Change in Transit Speeds for LRT in Salt Lake County. Green: Increase in Speeds — Red: Decrease in Speeds.\n\n\ntbl-lrt-speed shows the resulting average speeds along entire light rail routes. The net effect of the update was generally lower speeds, with the TRAX-Blue line and the S-Line having the largest drops in speed with a drop of 8.2% and 14.5%, respectively.\n\n\nCode\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\ntable = [[\"TRAX-Blue\" ,'24.4','22.4','-2.0','-8.2% '],\n         [\"TRAX-Green\",'19.2','18.6','-0.6','-3.1% '],\n         [\"TRAX-Red\"  ,'24.4','23.6','-0.8','-3.3% '],\n         [\"S-Line\"    ,'13.8','11.8','-2.0','-14.5%']]\nMarkdown(tabulate(\n  table, \n  headers=[\"Route\",\"Before Updates\", \"After Updates\", \"Difference\", \"% Difference\"]\n))\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Average Travel Speed (MPH) by Route for LRT\n\n\nRoute\nBefore Updates\nAfter Updates\nDifference\n% Difference\n\n\n\n\nTRAX-Blue\n24.4\n22.4\n-2\n-8.2%\n\n\nTRAX-Green\n19.2\n18.6\n-0.6\n-3.1%\n\n\nTRAX-Red\n24.4\n23.6\n-0.8\n-3.3%\n\n\nS-Line\n13.8\n11.8\n-2\n-14.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional changes include the following:\n\nFrontRunner speeds were adjusted to match the 2019 schedule\nSeveral SEGID changes to match UDOT 2019 Segment shapefile\nCorrected I-15 SB to include lane drop north of Lehi 2100 North interchange and lane add south of interchange to match constructefacility\nUpdated GIS link & node shapefiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHand-coded walk-access links are an additional input for transit beyond the automatically generated walk-access links. Auto-generated walk-access links are created between zone centroids and transit stops within a certain distance as defined by area of the zone, as long as they do not cross barriers as defined by functional type. Hand-coded walk-access links are user-defined, supplemental walk access where an auto-generated link would not be created or where walk access is more attractive than the TAZ structure and auto-generated links would suggest.\nThe update process removed a majority of the general hand-coded walk access links, reducing the number from 234 to 31 links. Areas that retained or added hand-coded links include SLC International Airport, Hill Air Force Base, University of Utah, and Utah Valley University. Figure 3 shows hand-coded walk-access links before and after the updates.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Hand-Coded Walk Access Links.\n\n\n\n\n\nPark-and-Ride lots are coded onto nodes within the master highway network and are defined by what transit mode they service. To be used by the travel model, park-and-ride nodes need to be coded at nodes that serve as rail or bus stops. Figure 4 (a) shows what changes were made to park-and-ride lots, which include 17 additional locations, 49 removed locations, and 14 locations that were modified by changing the mode they service. Most of the park-and-ride lots removals were due to redundancy on highway nodes adjacent to another park-and-ride lot at a rail node. The park-and-ride lots additions mostly included new lots along express bus routes. The resulting park-and-ride lot locations, including ones that were not edited, are shown in Figure 4 (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Park-And-Ride Lot Changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Park-And-Ride Lots After Updates\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Park-And-Ride Lots. Red: Removed — Green: Added — Blue: Modified\n\n\n\n\n\nTransit line files were updated based on actual 2019 route configuration. Transit line files include route alignments, stop locations, and peak/off-peak headway designation. Additionally, 2024, 2030, 2040, 2050, 2030UF, 2040UF, 2050UF transit was updated to reflect 2019 input changes.\nA general edit that was made to all lines that connect directly to rail was the removal of bus stops on a roadway node directly adjacent to a stop at a rail node. Only the rail node stop remains. Due to the amount of lines affected by this change, they are not listed individually in the line details below. There were also a couple of highway network edits made in relation to transit line changes:\n\nAt the Blue Line end-of-line in Draper, the centroid connector for the rail station connection to the highway network moved offintersection of Pioneer Road / 1300 East intersection and connected directly to Pioneer Drive.\nA connection between 24th Street and Wall Avenue in Ogden was added to represent the existing connection on each side of theviaduct. The associated transit-only link was removed.\n\nThe line file changes are shown in the lists below, arranged by file and route name.

    "text": "The Life Cycle model determines the how much of the TAZ population and households from the processed socioeconomic input file will be in one of three life cycle categories:\n\nLife Cycle 1 – households with no children and no seniors\nLife Cycle 2 – households with children and no seniors\nLife Cycle 3 – households with seniors (may have children)\n\nThe Life Cycle model does its calculations in three phases:\n\nDetermine the TAZ population that is in three age groups\nDetermine each age group population that is in the three life cycle categories\nDetermine the number of households in each life cycle category\n\n\n\nThe Life Cycle model first estimates how much of the TAZ population falls into one of three Age Group categories:\n\nAge Group 1 – 0 to 17 years old\nAge Group 2 – 18 to 64 years old\nAge Group 3 – 65+ years old\n\nThe initial share of the TAZ population in each Age Group is determined by multiplying the TAZ household population by the TAZ-level Age Group percentages in the Lookup - BYTAZAgePct - AllCo.csv file located in the 1_Inputs\\0_GlobalData\\1_HHDisag_AutoOwn directory. These initial TAZ-level Age Group percentages were calculated from 2020 Census block and 2020 ACS block group data summarized at the TAZ level.\nThe Census data was also summarized at the medium district level. If the Census TAZ data had fewer than 50 people, the percentages from medium districts were used. The medium district distribution of 2020 Census Age Group percentages for the Wasatch Front can be seen in the following Figure. The share of population in each of the Age Groups varies significantly by geography. Urban areas tend to have the highest share of population 18-64 years old and the fewest children and seniors. Suburban and rural areas tend to have the highest share of children.\n\n\n\n                                                \n2020 Census % Population by Age Group by Medium District.\n\n\nThe initial TAZ-based population by Age Group is then factored to reflect the year being modeled. This is done using the county population by Age Group forecasts found in ControlTotal_Age.csv located in 1_Inputs\\2_SEData\\_ControlTotals directory. The Age Group county-level percentages are calculated from county-level population projections from the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute (GPI), 2020-2060 State and County Total Population by Sex and Single-Year of Age. The GPI projections show a trend in all counties in the Wasatch Front model space toward a more senior population and fewer children. Adult population in the age range of 18-64 also saw a slight increase in population share.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 1: GPI County Population Projections by Age Group for Wasatch Front Counties.\n\n\n\nThe 2020 model base year population by county and Age Group was compared to the 2020 GPI county-level population by Age Group, shown in the following charts. The model’s estimate of the population in each Age Group mirrors the GPI county-level projections.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 2: 2020 Model vs. 2020 GPI – % Population by Age Group and County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Life Cycle model uses parameters estimated from the 2012 Household Survey to convert population in Age Groups to population in a Life Cycle category.

Life Cycle 3 has no adults age 18-64 leaving the 18-64 population to be divided between Life Cycles 1 and 2. All of 65+ population lies completely within Life Cycle 3.

The majority of the adult-not-a-senior population is contained in Life Cycle category 2, ranging between 52.5% in Salt Lake County and 71.1% in Davis County, with the remainder falling into Life Cycle 1.\nThe shares of the modeled 2019 base year population by Life Cycle were compared to the 2012 Household Survey at the county level. The model’s estimate of population by Life Cycle category seemed reasonable at this level of geography with all modeled comparison points falling within 4% of the observed data.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 3: 2019 Model vs. 2012 Household Survey – % Population by Life Cycle and County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Life Cycle model calculates households by Life Cycle using the average household size for each Life Cycle category.

The share of households in each Life Cycle category is then multiplied by the total households in the TAZ to get the adjusted number of households per Life Cycle category.\nA final check is made to avoid unrealistic household sizes for zones with smaller populations. The number of households for a given Life Cycle category are capped at the minimum and maximum household sizes found in Table 4.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Allowed Minimum and Maximum Average Household Size by Life Cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Cycle Category\nMinimum Household Size\nMaximum Household Size\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n4\n\n\n2\n2\n8\n\n\n3\n1\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shares of the modeled 2019 base year households by Life Cycle were compared to the 2012 Household Survey at the county level.

    "text": "The Household Disaggregation model classifies a TAZ’s households by:\n\nHousehold Size\nIncome\nNumber of Workers\n\nHousehold Disaggregation is done in three steps with each step adding another level of disaggregation: estimating the distribution of households by size group, further disaggregation by income group and income level, and further disaggregation by number of workers per household. This results in 96 groupings when using the four income groups or 48 groupings when using low/high income levels.\nFor disaggregation to household size groups, the following lookup files contain the distribution of households across the six household size groups according the average household size for the three life cycle categories: Lookup - HH Size_LC1.csv, Lookup - HH Size_LC2.csv, and Lookup - HH Size_LC3.csv. The distributions in these files are grouped by county. There is also a third lookup file that contains a regional distribution used for comparison purposes: Lookup - HH Size.csv. When computing income ratios, the regional median household income of $74,946 (2019 dollars) is used from the latest ACS.\nFurther disaggregation by income groups is done in multiple steps. First a target TAZ distribution by income is calculated using a county distribution found in Lookup - Income.csv. Then a Fratar/Furness balancing method is used to get the matrix distribution across income groups and household sizes. The matrix is initialized with the values found in Table 1, which is hard-coded into the 2_HHDisaggregation.s script with the source being the 2012 Household Survey. The balancing method is run through until convergence is reached at (0.0001) or a max of 15 iterations.\n\n\nCode\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\ntable = [['1', '0.591', '0.167' , '0.210', '0.032'],\n         ['2', '0.286', '0.155' , '0.351', '0.208'],\n         ['3', '0.253', '0.180' , '0.351', '0.216'],\n         ['4', '0.211', '0.151' , '0.395', '0.243'],\n         ['5', '0.154', '0.157' , '0.460', '0.229'],\n         ['6', '0.118', '0.122' , '0.479', '0.281']]\nMarkdown(tabulate(\n  table, \n  headers=[\"Householde Size\",\"Income Group 1 Seed\", \"Income Group 2 Seed\", \"Income Group 3 Seed\", \"Income Gruop 4 Seed\"],\n  tablefmt=\"pipe\", \n  colalign=(\"left\",)*5\n))\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Initialization Seed Values for Household Size and income Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouseholde Size\nIncome Group 1 Seed\nIncome Group 2 Seed\nIncome Group 3 Seed\nIncome Gruop 4 Seed\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.591\n0.167\n0.21\n0.032\n\n\n2\n0.286\n0.155\n0.351\n0.208\n\n\n3\n0.253\n0.18\n0.351\n0.216\n\n\n4\n0.211\n0.151\n0.395\n0.243\n\n\n5\n0.154\n0.157\n0.46\n0.229\n\n\n6\n0.118\n0.122\n0.479\n0.281\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal disaggregation by worker is a simple distribution which is found in the Lookup – Worker.csv file. This file contains a distribution across the worker groups by each of the 24 combinations of the six household size groups and the four income groups. Households are then aggregated back to the two income levels (low/high).\n\n\nThe Household Disaggregation model estimates how many households are in six Household Size categories:\n\n1 person households\n2 person households\n3 person households\n4 person households\n5 person households\n6 or more person households\n\nThe model uses the TAZ’s average household size to look up the share of households in each of the six Household Size categories. This is done independently for each of the three Life Cycle categories estimated in the previous model step.\nUPDATE 2010 Census Block Group data was used to determine the initial relationship between average household size and the number of households in each size category. To increase sample size, all Block Groups in Utah were included. Draft curves were estimated from the data’s polynomial trendline."

In the short term and to be consistent with v832 and earlier methodology the following values were used for Airport & Lagoon parking costs:\n\nLagoon\n\n‘PRKCSTPERM’=0\n’PRKCSTTEMP’Lagoon = $6.00\nThe 2022 cost is $18 per day\nAt an estimated average occupancy of 3 people per vehicle, that would equal $6\nPrevious PRKCSTTEMP value was $5 in 2010 dollars representing a $1 increase in 2019 dollars (20 percent) over 9 years (seems reasonable)\n\nAirport\n\n‘PRKCSTPERM’=0\n’PRKCSTTEMP’Lagoon = $1.25\nThe 2022 the cost is $5 per hour for short term garage, $2 per hour for short term economy and $0 for drop offs\nAt the occupancy of 2 people per vehicle (just a guess), that would equal $2.50, $1.00, and $0.00, respectively. The average of the three is $1.75. Given the unknown distribution of travelers, but assuming more drop-offs than parking, a lower value than $1.75 should be expected. The 2019 cost was chosen to be $1.25.\nPrevious PRKCSTTEMP value was $1 in 2010 dollars representing a $1 increase in 2019 dollars (25 percent) over 9 years. This growth seems reasonable, especially given the recent improvements to the airport.

In the short term and to be consistent with v832 and earlier methodology the following values were used for Airport & Lagoon parking costs:\n\nLagoon\n\n‘PRKCSTPERM’=0\n’PRKCSTTEMP’Lagoon = $6.00\nThe 2022 cost is $18 per day\nAt an estimated average occupancy of 3 people per vehicle, that would equal $6\nPrevious PRKCSTTEMP value was $5 in 2010 dollars representing a $1 increase in 2019 dollars (20 percent) over 9 years (seems reasonable)\n\nAirport\n\n‘PRKCSTPERM’=0\n’PRKCSTTEMP’Lagoon = $1.25\nThe 2022 the cost is $5 per hour for short term garage, $2 per hour for short term economy and $0 for drop offs\nAt the occupancy of 2 people per vehicle (just a guess), that would equal $2.50, $1.00, and $0.00, respectively. The average of the three is $1.75. Given the unknown distribution of travelers, but assuming more drop-offs than parking, a lower value than $1.75 should be expected. The 2019 cost was chosen to be $1.25.\nPrevious PRKCSTTEMP value was $1 in 2010 dollars representing a $1 increase in 2019 dollars (25 percent) over 9 years. This growth seems reasonable, especially given the recent improvements to the airport. (Additionally, the CPI adjustment of the 2010 $1 value to a 2019 value is $1.18 (https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.html).)\n\n\n\nUpdated Small District definition & name\n\nSmall Districts now nest within Medium Districts\n‘DISTSML’ index is sequential with 129 total districts\n‘DSML_NAME’ includes a prefix of Medium District index followed by Small District count (e.g. 15:1)\nSmall Districts are set up to work with Street Light data processing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded to District Folder:\n\n‘WF_Subarea.shp’\n‘Dist_REMM_Area.shp’\n\nUpdated:\n\n‘Dist_Small.shp’\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded ’_Source’ folder with following shapefile data sets:\n\nCities\nCounty\nDistricts\nEnvConstraints\n\nAdded ’__ViewTAZDistricts’ folder with ArcGIS Pro project & mapping files"
