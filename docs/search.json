Also, corrected capacity lookup to be for FT=37 and not FT of link.\n\n\n\n\nThe walk buffer script was improved with a couple simple modifications to the routes and stops that are included in walk buffer creation: - Removed local bus route buffers along expressways and freeways (anything with FT&gt;=12). Only local bus routes along arterials or collectors are now included in route buffers. - Removed buffers that were calculated from local bus stops, which were redundant with local bus route buffers. - The remaining combined walk buffer areas are shown in green.

    "text": "Model Results - Comparison with v8.3.1\nFigure 1 shows a comparison of daily roadway volume in the v8.3.2 model compared to the v8.3.1 model. Roadway links in red demonstrate an increase in traffic and green show a decrease in traffic between the new and the old model. The thicker the line and darker the color, the greater the magnitude of change. At the region level, the changes show that v.8.3.2 includes greater county-to-county flows as demonstrated in the 2019 base year with volume between Salt Lake County and both Davis and Utah Counties increasing while roadways such as I-80, I-215, and SR-201 showing decreasing traffic. This pattern is continued in the 2050 model with the intensity of change increasing on north/south freeways and arterials.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Model Daily Volumes Comparison (v8.3.2 vs v8.3.1).\n\n\nComparison of the highway volume validations of the v8.3.2 and v8.3.1 models are shown in Figure 2. There are separate charts by facility type and by county, as well as vehicle type. Medium and heavy truck trip generations and trip-length-frequencies were adjusted in the calibration process to bring model truck volumes closer in line with observed. Overall, for all vehicles the v8.3.2 model is closer to observed with all facility types within 4% of observed. Utah County improves significantly to only 1% low while Box Elder, Weber, and Davis counties are a couple percent lower than v8.3.1. When looked at by facility type, medium and heavy trucks see major improvements with minor arterials and major collectors and are much closer to observed by significant margins, but overall are slightly lower than observed as compared to v8.3.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Highway Volumes Validation (v8.3.2 and v8.3.1).\n\n\nFigure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5 show a comparison between daily model volumes by vehicle type with observed traffic volumes. There are slight changes in the All Vehicles figures between v8.3.2 and v8.3.1. Greater improvements are seen in the Medium and Heavy Truck figures, especially in the Box Elder and the Mountain View Corridor areas.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: All Vehicles Daily Volumes Comparison (Model vs Observed).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Medium Trucks Daily Volumes Comparison (Model vs Observed).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Heavy Trucks Daily Volumes Comparison (Model vs Observed)\n\n\nTransit ridership between v8.3.1 and v8.3.1 were compared at the trips, boardings, and mode share levels. Figure 6 and Figure 7 show a comparison of daily transit ridership and boardings for both the v8.3.2 and the v8.3.1 models. The v8.3.1 and v8.3.2 model transit was calibrated to the UTA On-Board Survey for 2015 and 2019, respectively, so the ridership for each of those models falls right on the OBS target. The boardings for the model are estimated but are close to average annual boardings as reported by UTA. Boardings between 2015 and 2019 have been relatively flat. The increase to 2050 is based on increased transit attractiveness and more supportive land use as built into the model.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Daily Transit Ridership - All Modes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Daily Boardings - All Modes.\n\n\nShare by transit mode is shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 for v8.3.2 and v8.3.1, respectively. In v8.3.2, Core Bus routes (Mode 5) show a greater portion of trips in v8.3.2 than in v8.3.1. These additional trips come mostly from Light Rail, which actually sees a decrease in mode share in 2030. Commuter Rail shares remain relatively consistent, as well as BRT.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Share by Transit Mode – v8.3.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Share by Transit Mode – v8.3.1.\n\n\nEven though the transit ridership forecasts are lower by 23% in v8.3.2 compared to v8.3.1, the 2019 to 2050 ratios for each model are similar with 2.0 in v8.3.2 and 2.2 in v8.3.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Comparison of 2019 and 2050 ratios.\n\n\nAs mentioned in a previous section, county-level adjustments were made in Davis and Utah counties to help better align station boardings in the model with observed. The comparison of the models with observed is shown in Figure 11. Due to these adjustments, there is a slight increase in Utah County boardings. However, Provo Station decreased slightly to just over half of what is observed. Davis County boardings proved to be more sensitive to the adjustment and a significant decrease is shown but still higher than observed boardings.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: 2019 Daily FrontRunner Boardings by Station Compared to Observed."

    "text": "Transit Network\n\nHand-Coded Walk-Access Links\nHand-coded walk-access links are an additional input for transit beyond the automatically generated walk-access links. Auto-generated walk-access links are created between zone centroids and transit stops within a certain distance as defined by area of the zone, as long as they do not cross barriers as defined by functional type. Hand-coded walk-access links are user-defined, supplemental walk access where an auto-generated link would not be created or where walk access is more attractive than the TAZ structure and auto-generated links would suggest.\nThe update process removed a majority of the general hand-coded walk access links, reducing the number from 234 to 31 links. Areas that retained or added hand-coded links include SLC International Airport, Hill Air Force Base, University of Utah, and Utah Valley University. Figure 3 shows hand-coded walk-access links before and after the updates.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Hand-Coded Walk Access Links.\n\n\n\n\nPark-And-Ride\nPark-and-Ride lots are coded onto nodes within the master highway network and are defined by what transit mode they service. To be used by the travel model, park-and-ride nodes need to be coded at nodes that serve as rail or bus stops. Figure 4 (a) shows what changes were made to park-and-ride lots, which include 17 additional locations, 49 removed locations, and 14 locations that were modified by changing the mode they service. Most of the park-and-ride lots removals were due to redundancy on highway nodes adjacent to another park-and-ride lot at a rail node. The park-and-ride lots additions mostly included new lots along express bus routes. The resulting park-and-ride lot locations, including ones that were not edited, are shown in Figure 4 (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Park-And-Ride Lot Changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Park-And-Ride Lots After Updates\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Park-And-Ride Lots. Red: Removed — Green: Added — Blue: Modified\n\n\n\n\nTransit Line Changes\nTransit line files were updated based on actual 2019 route configuration. Transit line files include route alignments, stop locations, and peak/off-peak headway designation. Additionally, 2024, 2030, 2040, 2050, 2030UF, 2040UF, 2050UF transit was updated to reflect 2019 input changes.\nA general edit that was made to all lines that connect directly to rail was the removal of bus stops on a roadway node directly adjacent to a stop at a rail node. Only the rail node stop remains. Due to the amount of lines affected by this change, they are not listed individually in the line details below. There were also a couple of highway network edits made in relation to transit line changes:\n\nAt the Blue Line end-of-line in Draper, the centroid connector for the rail station connection to the highway network moved offintersection of Pioneer Road / 1300 East intersection and connected directly to Pioneer Drive.\nA connection between 24th Street and Wall Avenue in Ogden was added to represent the existing connection on each side of theviaduct. The associated transit-only link was removed.\n\nThe line file changes are shown in the lists below, arranged by file and route name. Only lines that have changes, other than those listed above, are included.\nmag_brt_2019.lin\n\nBRT_ProOrm:\n\nstops removed:\n\n24779 - Geneva Road\n26400 - 900 E/Campus Ln\n26487 - 750 S/100 W\n\nStops moved:\n\n22881 to 26206 (from intersection of University Pkwy/900 E to the west)\n25972 to 23019 (moved further west to intersection of 400 E/700 N)\n23069 to 26203 (moved further north off of intersection of 200 N/Univ Ave)\n23066 to 26202 (moved further south off of intersection of 300 S/Univ Ave)\n26184 to 26192 (moved off University Ave and onto Town Centre Blvd)\n23160 to 24332 (moved west of intersection East Bay Blvd/1860 S)\n\nAlignment changed: Off of University Avenue between 920 S and Town Centre Drive and onto Town Centre Blvd\n\n\nmag_exp_2019.lin\n\nM807_NoCnty: Many stops removed.

However, BRT Mode 5 continues to use a multiplier of the LRT constant and was increased to 0.40 from 0.33.\nAdjustments were made to FrontRunner to bring station boardings closer to observed. Davis County boardings were significantly higher than observed, while Utah County boardings were significantly lower. A +15 multiplier of initial in-vehicle time penalty was added to all stations in Davis County, while -15 multiplier of in-vehicle time was added to all stations in Utah County. This brought boardings closer to observed, but there is still significant difference in boardings that should be accounted for when using the model for any station-level forecasts.
