Decreases in volume in v9 compared to v8.3.2 are shown in blue, while increases are shown in red.\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"html\"}\nThe comparison between daily volumes at the segment level can be found in @fig-pdf-volume-comparison for 2019 and 2050. Decreases in volume in v9 compared to v8.3.2 are shown in blue, while increases are shown in red.\n:::\n\nFor 2019, Salt Lake and northern Davis counties display a drop in roadway volumes, most apparent on I-15. Weber, southern Davis, and Utah Counties show increases. Most of the changes are relatively minor, with the largest decreases occurring on the freeways in Salt Lake County. However, given the large daily volume for these roadways, the percent change is relatively low.\n\nFor 2050, there are decreases in volumes on I-15 in Salt Lake and northern Davis counties. Weber and northern Davis counties show overall increase in roadway volumes. Utah County shows the most change with the two Utah Lake crossings not part of the 2050 fiscally constrained scenario. The resulting drop in volumes is evident with increases on I-15.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\nThe comparison of daily medium and heavy truck volumes is found in @fig-volume-truck-comparison for 2019 and 2050.

Overall ridership increases significantly in v9, and Core Bus ridership takes a larger share of trips and boardings than in v8.3.2.\n\n### Transit Ridership\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\nTransit ridership in v9 compared to v8.3.2 shows significant increase in 2032, 2042, and 2050. See @fig-hy-tr-all. The total ridership in 2050 for v9 is 327,000 daily trips compared to the v8.3.2 model that showed 258,000 daily trips, which equates to 26% more trips. The additional trips is largely due to the improvements in commuter rail with increased frequency and speed together with the change in the model sensitivity to changes in headway.\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"html\"}\nTransit ridership in v9 compared to v8.3.2 shows significant increase in 2032, 2042, and 2050.

Light-Rail Transit sees an increase through 2028 and then a large decrease in 2032. This large decrease can be explained by the shift of riders from Light Rail to Core Bus routes, with a large number of core routes coming online in 2032.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n<!--'4a: Local Bus','4b: Core Bus','4c: Express Bus','4d: Bus-Rapid Transit','4e: Light-Rail Transit','4f: Commuter-Rail Transit'-->\n\n#### All Modes\n\n::: {.cell .caption-undefined execution_count=8}\n\n::: {#fig-hy-tr-all .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/vnd.plotly.v1+json, text/html\n```\n\nDaily Transit Ridership - All Modes\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Commuter Rail\n\n::: {.cell .caption-undefined execution_count=9}\n\n::: {#fig-hy-tr-crt .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/vnd.plotly.v1+json, text/html\n```\n\nDaily Transit Ridership - Commuter-Rail Transit\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Light Rail\n\n::: {.cell .caption-undefined execution_count=10}\n\n::: {#fig-hy-tr-lrt .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/vnd.plotly.v1+json, text/html\n```\n\nDaily Transit Ridership - Light-Rail Transit\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Bus Rapid Transit\n\n::: {.cell .caption-undefined execution_count=11}\n\n::: {#fig-hy-tr-brt .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/vnd.plotly.v1+json, text/html\n```\n\nDaily Transit Ridership - Bus Rapid Transit\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Express Bus\n\n::: {.cell .caption-undefined execution_count=12}\n\n::: {#fig-hy-tr-exp .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/vnd.plotly.v1+json, text/html\n```\n\nDaily Transit Ridership - Express Bus\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Core Bus\n\n::: {.cell .caption-undefined execution_count=13}\n\n::: {#fig-hy-tr-cor .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/vnd.plotly.v1+json, text/html\n```\n\nDaily Transit Ridership - Core Bus\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Local Bus\n\n::: {.cell .caption-undefined execution_count=14}\n\n::: {#fig-hy-tr-lcl .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/vnd.plotly.v1+json, text/html\n```\n\nDaily Transit Ridership - Local Bus\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![Daily Transit Ridership - All Modes](_pictures/pdf-hy-tr-all.png){#fig-pdf-hy-tr-all width=76%}\n\n![Daily Transit Ridership - Commuter-Rail Transit](_pictures/pdf-hy-tr-crt.png){#fig-pdf-hy-tr-crt width=76%}\n\n![Daily Transit Ridership - Light-Rail Transit](_pictures/pdf-hy-tr-lrt.png){#fig-pdf-hy-tr-lrt width=76%}\n\n![Daily Transit Ridership - Bus Rapid Transit](_pictures/pdf-hy-tr-brt.png){#fig-pdf-hy-tr-brt width=76%}\n\n![Daily Transit Ridership - Express Bus](_pictures/pdf-hy-tr-exp.png){#fig-pdf-hy-tr-exp width=76%}\n\n![Daily Transit Ridership - Core Bus](_pictures/pdf-hy-tr-cor.png){#fig-hy-tr-cor width=76%}\n\n![Daily Transit Ridership - Local Bus](_pictures/pdf-hy-tr-lcl.png){#fig-pdf-hy-tr-lcl width=76%}\n\n:::\n\n### Transit Share\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\nA comparison of the share of trips amongst the various modes of transit was done for both Trips and Boardings.\n\nThe transit ridership trip shares by mode can be found in @fig-shr-tr-all-9 for v9 and @fig-shr-tr-all-832 for v8.3.2. The main difference in v9 trip share by mode is the large increase in Core Bus trips in 2032 from almost nothing in 2028, while in v8.3.2 the increase in Core Bus trips is spread out between 2024 and 2030. This large increase is consistent with the transit inputs into the model with a large number of Core Bus routes coming into production in 2032, replacing mostly local bus service. The new Core Buy takes most of the local bus ridership it is replacing, but also quite a lot of ridership from Light Rail Transit (Mode 7).\n\nTransit boardings for v9 are found in @fig-brd-9 and for v8.3.2 are found in @fig-brd-832.
