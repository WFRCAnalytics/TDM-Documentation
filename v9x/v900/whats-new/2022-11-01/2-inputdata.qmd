# Input Data

## Global Data

### Mode Choice
 - Added input files regarding new bus speed ratios
    - Added 'bus_speed_ratios.csv' -- file containing the bus speed factors read in by the model
    - Added '_source - bus_speed_ratios.xlsx' -- source file for bus speed ratios csv

#### Update Transit Speed Factors
The factors to calculate bus speeds from congested auto speeds from the distribution loaded network were re-estimated based on Aug-Nov 2019 GTFS data from UTA. The functional groups were redefined and expanded to include area type as well as peak and off-peak. @fig-old-bus shows the previous bus speed factors and @fig-new-bus shows the new bus speed factors used in this model version.

### Assignment
 - Added lookup table & source file for diurnal and PA parameters (corresponding factors were removed from the ‘0GeneralParameters.block’ file)
    - 'Diurnal & PA factors.csv'
    - _source - Diurnal & PA factors.xlsx'
 - The 'Diurnal & PA factors.csv' was updated

## Highway Network
### Dated Updates

**MergedMasterNet - 2022-10-11**

 - Phase change for Managed Motorways in WFRC area
 - A couple of phasing updates from the WFRC RTP project list
 - Cleaned up GIS23_32 & GIS23_42 fields
 - Differentiated what projects will be built by 2028 from what will be built by 2023

## Externals
### External Matrices from USTM
The external matrices from USTM were updated:

 - Replaced AM, MD, PM, EV & DY external matrices from USTM’s subarea extraction process for the following years:
    - 2015 – copied DY matrix from 2019
    - 2019
    - 2023 – copied DY matrix from 2019
    - 2028 – copied DY matrix from 2032
    - 2032
    - 2042
    - 2050
 - USTM version used: 'USTM_v3.0 - 2022-09-15' which included TAZ, MasterNet, SE & loaded nets from 'WF TDM v9.0 - 2022-10-05'
