Changes made to the `2_ModelScripts\0_InputProcessing` folder are discussed in this section.

Global changes made to all the scripts in this folder included modifications to the script to account for removal of the `CITY`,  `COUNTY`, and `EXTERNAL` fields from the TAZ shapefile and updates to use true shape link and node shapefiles.

## Setup

The folder setup routine was integrated into the `HailMary.s` script to run automatically. It is no longer necessary to copy empty folders or run the `_CreateOutputFolders.s` prior to running the model .

## SE Processing

The `1_DemographicsAnalysis.s` script was updated to read <br>  
`ControlTotal_SE_AllCounties.csv`. Weber County contains two sets of indexes bus on whether it is the UDOT Subarea `9057` or the Wasatch Front Subarea `9157`.

## Network Processing

A bug in the Connected-and-Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) calculation was fixed where the column index was needed to be incremented by 1 to link up with lookup tables.

The hard-coded turn penalty node numbers in the `3_TurnPenalty.s` script were updated to the new master network node numbering.

## Time of Day Factors

A new file `1_CalculateTimeOfDayFac.s` is created during the model that includes time of day factors for use in following scripts.
