Changes made to the `2_ModelScripts\4_ModeChoice` folder are discussed in this section. Updates to the mode choice portion of the model include transit skims and district summaries.

## Transit Skims

Modifications to the transit skim script were made to incorporate the new bus speeds input file.

## District Summaries

The district summary script was modified to change `COUNTY` field references to `CO_FIPS` for county summaries due to removal of field from TAZ shapefile.
