title: v901-patch1 Update (2024-04-30)
---

## Changes to Input Files

An update to v9.0.1 related to SEGID and the SEGID exception fields was accidentally left out of the
version published on April 23, 2024, causing the model to crash. The updated scripts were added
back into the model.

A few minor edits were made to the highway network to correct the direction of a oneway frontage
road link and to add a few nodes/links to make the network more consistent with v9.0.2. The transit
line files were edited to reflect the updated highway network added nodes/links. No changes were
made to the RTP project list.
