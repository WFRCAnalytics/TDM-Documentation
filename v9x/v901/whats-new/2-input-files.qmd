### Changes to TAZ Attributes

The following attributes in the TAZ shapefile were updated (note, TAZ geometry and numbering were unchanged).

**City Name**

 - The value "Mill Creek" was replaced with "Millcreek" in the **CITY_NAME** field
 - The **CITY_UGRC** and **CITY_FIPS** fields were updated to be consistent with **CITY_NAME**
 - A new City district shapefile was created based on updated the city name and ID fields

**Developable Acres**

 - The **DEVACRES** and **DEVPBLEPCT** fields were set to 0 in TAZs with no developable land. A new point shapefile, `undevelopable-points_WF.shp`, was added to the `1_Inputs\1_TAZ\_Source\EnvConstraints` folder to keep track of these override undevelopable TAZs. @fig-undvp-tazes shows which TAZs had their fields set to 0. 

 ```{ojs}
//|echo: false

geojsonTaz    = FileAttachment("data/WFv901_TAZ_20240412.geojson"   ).json()
```

```{ojs}
//|label: fig-undvp-tazes

mapTazUndvp= {

  let container = DOM.element('div', { style: `width:${width}px;height:${width/1.6}px` });
  yield container;
  
  let map = L.map(container).setView([40.7608, -111.8910], 8.25);

  let greyLayer = L.tileLayer('https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png', {

  }).addTo(map);

  let tazColors = ['#00887F'   ,'#BD0026'       ]
  let tazLabels = ['Developable Space','Undevelopable Space'];
  
  let lyrTAZNew = L.geoJson(geojsonTaz, {
                            style: function(feature) {
                              var d = feature.properties.DEVPBLEPCT;
                              return d>0  ? {color:tazColors[0], weight:1, opacity:0.95} :
                                     d==0 ? {color:tazColors[1], weight:1, opacity:0.95} : 
                                            {color:    '#000000', weight:1, opacity:0.95} ;
                            }
  }).addTo(map);
  
  var legend = L.control({position: 'bottomleft'});
  legend.onAdd = function (map) {
    var div = L.DomUtil.create('div', 'legend');
    div.innerHTML = '';
    for (var i = 0; i < tazLabels.length; i++) {
      div.innerHTML += '<i style="background:' + tazColors[i] + '">&nbsp;</i> ' + tazLabels[i] + '<br/>';
    }

    // Add CSS style for the background color
    div.style.backgroundColor = 'lightgray';
    div.style.padding = '10px';
    
    return div;
  };
  legend.addTo(map);
}
```

### Rename TAZ Shapefile

The TAZ shapefile was renamed from `TAZ.shp` to `WFv901_TAZ_{date-stamp}.shp` to comply with the new model file naming convention determined by the Interagency Modeling Technical Committee (IMTC). The **TAZ_DBF** variable was updated in the `Scenarios\_default\ControlCenter.block` files. 

## Highway Network

### Network Changes due to Segment Shapefile Updates

The highway network was updated to coincide with the updates made to the segment shapefile (see the [Segment Shapefile](https://wfrc.org/wftdm-docs/v9x/v901/whats-new/2-input-files.html#segment-shapefile) section of this report). Primarily, these changes consisted of adding nodes, splitting links, and updating the **SEGID** link field. However, a few new corridors were added to the network and some link/nodes positions were changed to better align with the segment shapefile. The edits made to the network node and link geometry to accommodate desired segment updates constitute the vast majority of the geometric changes made to the network in version 9.0.1. Because of the large number of edits made to the highway link-node structure, the version 9.0.1 highway network is not backward compatible with version 9.0.0 highway network.

The complexity of the frontage road system in the highway network in future scenarios caused the value in the **SEGID** field to not be unique for all scenarios. To allow for a link's SEGID to change between scenarios, a set of SEGID exception fields were added to the Master Network. When SEGID changes in a scenario, the new SEGID is coded into the scenario's corresponding SEGID exception field. This will trigger an override of the SEGID calculation in the network processor script. Blank values use the primary SEGID field, i.e. no override. The field names for the SEGID exception field set follow the naming convention used for the lane and functional type field set:

 - Base and TIP years
    - SGX_2019
    - SGX_2023
 - SGX_2028
    - Fiscally Constrained Plan years
    - SGX23_32
    - SGX23_42
    - SGX23_50
 - Unfunded Need Plan years
    - SGX23_32UF
    - SGX23_42UF
    - SGX23_50UF

A new variable, **SegIdExField**, was added to the `1ControlCenter.block` file to select which SEGID exception field to use in the scenario.

### General Maintenance & Corrections

Clean up work was done to the highway network to fix errors or to do general maintenance. Below is a list of specific changes made to the highway network. Note that the project list coded into the v9.0.1 highway network represents the Regional Transportation Plans adopted May 2023.

### Rename Master Network
The master network was renamed from `MasterNet_v9 â€“ {date-stamp}.net` to `WFv901_MasterNet_{date-stamp}.net` to comply with the new model file naming convention determined by the Interagency Modeling Technical Committee (IMTC). The **MasterPrefix** variable was updated in the `Scenarios\_default\ControlCenter.block` files. 

## Transit Networks

### Changes to Transit Line Files

The changes made to the transit line files were to make the line files compatible with the highway network geometry edits, primarily where links were split along a transit route. The project list coded into the v9.0.1 transit network represents the Regional Transportation Plans adopted May 2023.

## Segment Shapefile

### Changes to Segment Attributes and Geometry

The segment shapefile was updated extensively to allow for future segment-level processing of the transit results, to develop a more accurate [traffic volume forecast](https://unifiedplan.org/traffic-volume-map/), and to correct for compatibility issues with the highway network. Hundreds of new segments were added and many were deleted or adjusted to better reflect the current and future physical roadway. Because of the large number of edits made to the segments, the segment shapefile and any segment reporting in version 9.0.1 are not backward compatible with version 9.0.0.

Overall, there were approximately 5000 changes to the **SEGID** value between version 9.0.0 and version 9.0.1. This includes the addition of around 3000 new SEGID values and the renaming of around 2000 SEGID values. SEGID shapefile edits were also reflected in the highway network. @tbl-segid-changes gives the percentage of SEGID changes by county. The majority of SEGID updates occurred in Utah County followed by Salt Lake County.

Eagle Mountain saw the most SEGID changes (22%), followed by Saratoga Springs (8%), Santaquin (6%), West Jordan (5%), and Payson (5%).

@fig-hwy-link-segid shows where SEGIDs changes occurred between versions 9.0.0 and 9.0.1 in the model network. This provides a representation of where new and adjusted segments are located in segment shapefile.

### Renamed Segment Shapefile

The segment shapefile was renamed from `Segments_WF â€“ {date-stamp}.shp` to `WFv901_Segments_{date-stamp}.shp` to comply with statewide naming standards as determined by the Interagency Modeling Technical Committee (IMTC). 

### Added `_Segment Processing Tools` Folder

A new methodology was developed and utilized for updating the segment shapefile. This process is documented in a Jupyter notebook file `0-How-to-Prep-Segments-for-TDM.ipynb` located in a new folder `1_Inputs\6_Segment\_Segment Processing Tools`. In short, this script outlines five steps to be followed when developing new and updated segments. 

1. Ensure consistency between the master network and segment shapefile.
    a. Unique **SEGIDs** in shapefile.
    b. Correct **DISTANCE**.
    c. Correct LRS Segments **BMP**, **EMP**, and **DISTANCE**.
    d. TDM Network includes all **SEGIDs**.
    e. Segment Shapefile includes all **SEGIDs**.
    f. Correct geographic coordinate system.
2. Add Geographic Keys onto Segments (**SUBAREAID**, **PLANAREA**, **CO_FIPS**).
3. Add AADTs onto Segments.
4. Add Factors from Continuous Count Station groups.
5. Add final forecasts from forecasts process.

This new process ensures the segment shapefile is ready for the traffic volume forecasts map, as well as ensures only the needed and relevant attributes are included.
