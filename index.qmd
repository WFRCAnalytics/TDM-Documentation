This website documents the progress of the Wasatch Front Travel Demand Model (TDM). The main topics of this site regard the *What's New? Documentation*, the complete *Model Documentation*, the *Calibration/Validation Report*, and various other resources worth noting -- all for different model versions.

Wasatch Front Regional Council (WFRC) alongside Mountainland Association of Governments (MAG) facilitates the development and documentation of the TDM.

## Modeling Region
@fig-wf-tdm shows the modeling area for the Wasatch Front region. It is composed of the urbanized areas within Box Elder, Davis, Salt Lake, Utah, and Weber counties.
