title:  "Documentation"

Documentation of the Wasatch Front Travel Demand Model (WF TDM) has been separated into three documents:

 - What’s New Report – describes the changes made to the WF TDM since the last model release
 - Validation Report – provides the base year validation of the current version of the WF TDM, as well as a reasonableness check of the model as a forecasting tool
 - Model Process Report – provides an overview of the model, a summary of the model’s input data sets, and an outline of the model’s primary steps and logic

These reports will be available as PDF documents in the "_Notes" folder in the WF TDM’s root directory. However, it is expected that the primary means of accessing the model’s documentation will be online at the following links:

 - [What’s New](https://wfrc.org/wftdm-docs/v9x/v900/whats-new/1-genparams.html)
 - [Validation Report](https://wfrc.org/wftdm-docs/v9x/v900/validation/1-hhdisag-autoown.html)
 - Model Process Report (in progress)
 - Previous Versions (in progress)
