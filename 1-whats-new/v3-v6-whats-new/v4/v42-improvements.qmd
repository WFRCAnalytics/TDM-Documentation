## The “What, When, and Why” of the next likely improvements.
## HOV and HOT lane modeling (April, 2005)
Scoping for the I-15 EIS in Utah County determined that modeling HOV and HOT (toll lanes) is an important element of their study.  They would like to work with a model that has these elements in early 2005.  PB Consult is assisting us in developing and implementing these Mode Choice features.  This improvement will not measurably affect results in any ongoing study, but ongoing studies may be interested in utilizing this feature.

## Long Term
### HBW destination choice
We’ve been working with PB Consult to develop a Home-Based Work destination choice model.  It will likely undergo testing and possibly be implemented by early next summer.  

### UrbanSim
Andy Li is making great progress is being made on testing and implementing UrbanSim.  We hope to use it to assist in the development and analysis of the next long-range plan (due in 2006).  

### Home Interview Survey
There is continued debate about what exactly is needed in this arena.  The committee involved in this is wrestling with how to scope for this, and design a survey or several surveys that will get us the most valuable information available for the money.

### Replace *TRNBUILD* with *PUBLIC TRANSPORT*
The transit travel times and assignment utilize the Citilab’s TrnBuild module, which is a carry over from the Minutp platform.  Citilabs ceased development on TrnBuild after acquiring the Public Transport (PT) module from a European firm that specialized in transit route choice and graphical display of results.  As we learn more about PT, we will replace TrnBuild.  We are unsure as to how much this will improve our accuracy of modeling transit, but it will certainly allow us access to better graphics and analytical methods, which alone should highlight opportunities for improvement.
