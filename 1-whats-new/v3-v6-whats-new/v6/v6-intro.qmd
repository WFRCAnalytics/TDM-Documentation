## Introduction
This document summarizes the important changes to the WFRC-MAG travel modeling process now available for use. The document is not intended to be comprehensive and it is targeted towards an audience familiar with travel modeling. If you have questions, please contact Chad Worthen (cworthen@wfrc.org).

See earlier “What’s new?” documents to understand other model elements that were worked on in earlier stages. Model Version 6 is similar in many ways to version 5, but enough time had passed and new model inputs were available, so a new model version number was warranted.
