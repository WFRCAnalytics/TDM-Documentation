# Input Data

## Highway Network
Speed factor changes were made to the following locations:

- US-89 North Davis County SFAC_BASE adjusted to 0.82
- Legacy Pkwy South of Parrish SFAC_BASE and SFAC_FUT set to 0.95
- University Avenue from 300 South to 700 N SFAC_BASE and SFAC_FUT set to 0.85

Capacity factors changes were made to the following locations:

- Provo Center Street from 500 West to University Ave CFAC_BASE and CFAC_FUT set to 0.85

### Amendment 3
The highway network was updated in the MAG and WFRC areas to reflect the third round of Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) amendments.  Additional edits were made in the MAG area to conform with more recent project clarification. @fig-lane-change shows where lanes were added (green) or were taken away (orange) between versions 8.3 and 8.3.1 highway networks.

### Light Rail Transit Speed
The speed of rail transit is coded onto rail-only links within the master highway network. Transit speed for LRT were updated to reflect 2019 operations. Most of the speed changes were less than 5 mph. @fig-transit-speed-change shows where light rail speeds were changed. 

![Change in Transit Speeds for LRT in Salt Lake County. Green: Increase in Speeds — Red: Decrease in Speeds.](_pictures/transit-speed-change.png){#fig-transit-speed-change}

tbl-lrt-speed shows the resulting average speeds along entire light rail routes. The net effect of the update was generally lower speeds, with the TRAX-Blue line and the S-Line having the largest drops in speed with a drop of 8.2% and 14.5%, respectively.

Additional changes include the following:

- FrontRunner speeds were adjusted to match the 2019 schedule
- Several SEGID changes to match UDOT 2019 Segment shapefile
- Corrected I-15 SB to include lane drop north of Lehi 2100 North interchange and lane add south of interchange to match constructefacility
- Updated GIS link & node shapefiles

## Transit Network

### Hand-Coded Walk-Access Links
Hand-coded walk-access links are an additional input for transit beyond the automatically generated walk-access links. Auto-generated walk-access links are created between zone centroids and transit stops within a certain distance as defined by area of the zone, as long as they do not cross barriers as defined by functional type. Hand-coded walk-access links are user-defined, supplemental walk access where an auto-generated link would not be created or where walk access is more attractive than the TAZ structure and auto-generated links would suggest.

The update process removed a majority of the general hand-coded walk access links, reducing the number from 234 to 31 links. Areas that retained or added hand-coded links include SLC International Airport, Hill Air Force Base, University of Utah, and Utah Valley University. @fig-walk-access-links shows hand-coded walk-access links before and after the updates.

### Park-And-Ride
Park-and-Ride lots are coded onto nodes within the master highway network and are defined by what transit mode they service. To be used by the travel model, park-and-ride nodes need to be coded at nodes that serve as rail or bus stops. @fig-pnr-changes shows what changes were made to park-and-ride lots, which include 17 additional locations, 49 removed locations, and 14 locations that were modified by changing the mode they service. Most of the park-and-ride lots removals were due to redundancy on highway nodes adjacent to another park-and-ride lot at a rail node. The park-and-ride lots additions mostly included new lots along express bus routes. The resulting park-and-ride lot locations, including ones that were not edited, are shown in @fig-pnr-after.

### Transit Line Changes
Transit line files were updated based on actual 2019 route configuration. Transit line files include route alignments, stop locations, and peak/off-peak headway designation. Additionally, 2024, 2030, 2040, 2050, 2030UF, 2040UF, 2050UF transit was updated to reflect 2019 input changes.

A general edit that was made to all lines that connect directly to rail was the removal of bus stops on a roadway node directly adjacent to a stop at a rail node. Only the rail node stop remains. Due to the amount of lines affected by this change, they are not listed individually in the line details below.
There were also a couple of highway network edits made in relation to transit line changes: 

- At the Blue Line end-of-line in Draper, the centroid connector for the rail station connection to the highway network moved offintersection of Pioneer Road / 1300 East intersection and connected directly to Pioneer Drive.
- A connection between 24th Street and Wall Avenue in Ogden was added to represent the existing connection on each side of theviaduct. The associated transit-only link was removed.

The line file changes are shown in the lists below, arranged by file and route name. Only lines that have changes, other than those listed above, are included.

## Segments and Factors
The Master Segments shapefile was updated with the following changes:

- Day-of-week, season, and month factors were updated using 2015-2019 data from UDOT Continuous Count Stations (CCS). To be consistent with the UDOT AADT process, any year of data without a full week of data from each month was excluded from the factor creation.
- Created single grouping of CCS for all factors (previously weekday and month/season factors were based on separate groupings).
- Changed average weekday factor (FAC_WDAVG) to represent Tuesday through Thursday (previously Monday through Thursday).
- Changed average and max weekend factors (FAC_WEAVG, FAC_WEMAX) to represent Saturday and Sunday (previously Friday through Sunday).

## Other Changes
The following were additional changes made to the model: 

- An additional districting grouping ('DISTSUPER' and 'DSUP_NAME') was added to the TAZ shapefile using definitions from UDOT’s recent work on the long distance model. 
- The toll zone shapefile was also modified to correct a few instances where the HOT lane links were crossing into the opposing direction HOT zone.
- The '1_Inputs\\0_GlobalData\\UbanizationMap' folder name was changed to '1_Inputs\\0_GlobalData\\ArcMap_mxd. The '_Urbanization_ArcMap103.mxd' file was saved as ArcMap version 10.3 and the ArcMap version was added to the filename
- The TDM script '_CreateOutputFolders.s' in '3_CreateScenarios' folder was modified to account for the changed folder and file names for the urbanization.mxd.
