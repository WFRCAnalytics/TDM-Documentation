# Highway Assignment

The fowllowing changes were made in highway assignment scripts:

- Segment summary processing script was updated to include truck volumes in detailed output.
- In harmony with the changes in distribution, truck speed factors are now applied to all facility types, were previously they applied only to freeway.

Access-to-Opportunity (ATO) scripts were moved to the Assignment folder. The following edits were made to the ATO script:

- Made output field names more descriptive.
- Changed output format from dbf to csv.
- Added Free Flow auto time and straight-line time (based on auto free flow) ATO calculations/output
- Updated script to get the ATO weights from empirical HBW distance decay curve from Household Travel Survey as a look up table rather than calculate from a step function.
