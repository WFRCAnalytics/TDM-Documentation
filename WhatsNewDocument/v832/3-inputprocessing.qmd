# Input Processing

## Inbound/Outbound and HOV Capacity
A couple bugs were corrected in the input processing script:

- Corrected inbound/outbound designations for EB/WB links.
- Removed FT=37-38 as a condition for populating link additional HOV capacity (AdHOVCap1H) values since related HOV fields are populated on GP links not HOV links. Also, corrected capacity lookup to be for FT=37 and not FT of link.

## Walk Buffer Modifications
The walk buffer script was improved with a couple simple modifications to the routes and stops that are included in walk buffer creation:
- Removed local bus route buffers along expressways and freeways (anything with FT>=12). Only local bus routes along arterials or collectors are now included in route buffers. 
- Removed buffers that were calculated from local bus stops, which were redundant with local bus route buffers.
- The remaining combined walk buffer areas are shown in green.
The '_WalkBuffer_ArcMap103.mxd' file was updated to version 10.3 of ArcMap, and the scripts were modified to copy the walk buffer mxd to scenario folders.
