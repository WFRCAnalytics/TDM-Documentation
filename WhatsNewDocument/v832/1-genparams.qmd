# General Parameters

For highway calibration purposes, KFACs were defined for the following county-to-county trips:

- KFAC for Utah County to/from Salt Lake County trips is set to 0.85.
- KFAC for Davis County to/from Salt Lake County trips is set to 0.95.
    
For transit calibration purposes, the BRT Mode 5 multiplier was set to 0.40. The Mode 9 multiplier was removed, since BRT Mode 9 was calibrated independently of LRT for v8.3.2.
