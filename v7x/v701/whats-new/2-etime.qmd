## Elapsed Time
The 'ElapsedTime.exe' file no longer worked with Windows 7.  The elapsed time code was removed from the model and replaced with a new method for monitoring model step runtimes. Code was added inside the scripts to print a text file at the beginning of various model steps. The model runtime can then be inferred by looking at the text file time stamps. Just one file is created at the beginning of the Input Processing, Auto Ownership and Trip Generation modeling steps. Beginning with Distribution, a text file is create for each script in the modeling step, with the exception of Mode Choice where scripts 2-3 do not generate a time stamp text file because the model runs fairly quickly through these scripts. The time stamp files are found in the '_ElapsedTime' folder in the root directory.
